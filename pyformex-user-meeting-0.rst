Subject

The aim of the first pyFormex user meeting was:

Minutes of the previous meeting
-------------------------------
None, obviously.

Agenda and discussion
---------------------
* pyFormex User Meeting:
  
  - Do we need a user meeting and how does it differ from the already available communication tools (news, forums, mailing lists, bug tracker) on the `pyFormex developer site`_?
    It is the general feeling that a regular User Meeting can be helpful by providing an extra channel for communication amongst pyFormex users and between users and developers (both upstream and downstream). 

  - Could a Wiki replace or complement the user meeting?
    Some kind of Wiki system could be helpful for the collaborative creation of tutorials and example galleries. However, setting up and maintaining a Wiki is currently not our primary concern. The idea will be tested out on the `UGent digital learning`_ system, in the framework of a course using pyFormex. Meanwhile, a tutorial will remain part of the pyFormex manual.
 
  - Where/when/how often will the meeting be held?
    The meeting will be held approximately monthly at `IBiTech`_. The meeting will be announced on the `pyFormex website`_, in the `pyFormex news`_, through the `pyformex-announce`_ mailing list and in the minutes of the previous meeting (tentative).

  - Who can attend the pyFormex user meeting?
    The pyFormex User Meeting will be open for anyone working with pyFormex or interested in its use. All we ask is that you announce your coming in advance by sending an email to the `pyFormex project manager`_.

  - What will be the aim and contents of the user meeting?
    Any topic concerning pyFormex can be discussed on the meeting.
    Users can share their experiences and team up to tackle problems together.
    Developers may present future features and will listen to user requests.
    While all users will be given the opportunity to raise a question at the meeting, time limitations may hinder a full discussion. If you want some topic to be treated in-depth, you should raise your question by email to the `pyFormex project manager`_, so that it can be put on the meeting's agenda. The same holds if you want to make some extended presentation of your work.

  - The minutes of the pyFormex User Meetings will be made accessible on the 
    `pyFormex website`_.
 

* pyFormex Developer Forum:

  - The `pyFormex project manager`_ presents the available communication channels on the  `pyFormex developer site`_, which should remain the primary means for discussing pyFormex development and use. The tools comprise:
    
    - The `pyFormex news`_ and the `pyformex-announce`_ mailing list, where all announcements about pyFormex are done. The most recent news is also displayed on the `pyFormex home page`_.
    - The `pyFormex forums`_. All users can access the 'Help' and 'Open Discussion' forums. The former is specifically to ask help from other pyFormex users and developers. The latter allows any pyFormex related topics to be discussed. 
    - When you are logged in as a pyFormex developer, one more forum will be available, the `pyFormex developer forum`_. This is the preferred place for discussion between developers. 
    - Finally, the `pyFormex bug tracking`_ system is where you should go to report bugs or anything that does not work like it should.
 
     All these tools are very powerful; please use them whenever appropriate.
  
  - The `pyFormex project manager`_ presents the current pyFormex license (GNU GPL 2 or higher) and explains why the project can and may move to the GPL version 3 in the near future. Also the current agreement on the copyright of the pyFormex source code is explained. It will be written down in clear text and added to the pyFormex repository and website. 
  - Benedict presents his latest results with the interactive picking of actors and elements.
  - Michele and some students will expand on the Abaqus interface.
  - Peter and Sofie developed a tool to query information on selected geometrical parts (points, lines,distances). It is currently available in the tools plugin.
  - Some work will be done to implement more analytical geometry (lines, planes, simple surfaces).

* pyFormex User Forum:

  - A gallery will be created on the `pyFormex website`_, where users can present geometrical models created with pyFormex.
  - Matthieu will work on a classification of the examples, in order to put them in structured menus.


* pyFormex contest:

  - The pyFormex GUI now has a splash screen. The current graphic was taken from the Scallopdome example. We invite all users to come up with a more elaborate image to be included in future versions. The only limitations are that it should be a PNG image not larger than 640x480 pixels, and be created by pyFormex.


Date of the next meeting
------------------------
The next meetings will be held Thursday, March 6, 2008 at 10.00h and (tentative) on Tuesday, April 8, 2008 at 14.00h.
