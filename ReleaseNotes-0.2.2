pyFormex 0.2.2 - release notes

This is an interim release celebrating the first anniversary of the pyFormex
project. A lot has been changed since the 0.2.1 release and we wanted you to
enjoy some of the new functions in pyFormex.

Many nice examples were added, some of them illustrating the practical use
of pyFormex. One example goes even into the strength analysis of the
designed structure, and displays the computed forces back in pyFormex.

See file Changelog for more details about changes in this release.
