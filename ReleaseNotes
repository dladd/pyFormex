pyFormex 0.7  Releasenotes 
============

This is a collection of the most prominent changes in pyFormex 0.7
(compared to the prevous release 0.6)

INSTALLATION
============
The prefered installation procedure
  python setup.py install --prefix=/usr/local
will now also install 
 - the acceleration library, if you have the necessary header files and
   compiler,
 - the xdg standard desktop and menu starters, if you have xdg-utils available


COMMAND LINE
============
The --dri/--nodri options should not be used, unless you need to change 
incorrect default settings.


GUI:
====
LOTS, LOTS, LOTS of new functions.

Some goodies: 
  - interactive picking
  - rendering of values on domains
  - lighting / smooth rendering is now fixed
  

CORE:
=====
Acceleration library
--------------------
Some critical functions have been implemented in C.
These are mostly some of the low-level drawing routines. 
The result is a dramatic speedup in drawing large structures.
The drawback is that these functions need to be compiled at
installation time, and this requires the existence of the needed
library headers (and a compiler). 
Therefore, we have made this acceleration library an optional
part of pyFormex. All functions in the library have a (slower)
Python equivalent. If your system does not have all the prerequistes,
the library will not be installed, but pyFormex will still run with
all its functionality, though some of them will be slower.


PLUGINS:
========
Important enhancements in the interfaces with simulation codes.
Implemented some automated meshing algorithms.
Expanded capablities of output in Abaqus and Fluent formats.
Partly implemented import of results from Abaqus simulations.
Started work on FEA/CFD postprocessing.
 

MANUAL:
=======
We started to add more thing into the manual. Still need to
do a lot. Look out for version 0.7.1 to have a more complete
manual.
