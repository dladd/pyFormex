pyFormex 0.8.6  Releasenotes
============================

This is a collection of the most prominent changes in pyFormex 0.8.6
compared to the previous release 0.8.5. There are not many new features
in this release. The major change is the installation procedure, triggered
by our attempts to create Debian packages. And we have a couple of bug fixes.


Installation
------------
- The installation procedure now includes a configuration file (setup.py)
  which sets the default installation prefix to '/usr/local'. The command to
  install (if you accept the defaults) is thus::

    python setup.py install

- Secondly, if the compilation of the acceleration libraries fails, the 
  installation procedure continues without the libraries.

- Finally, it is now possible to enforce installation without the libraries,
  by using the command::

    python setup.py install --no-accel


Gui
---
- Camera Settings dialog, with e.g. interactive front and back plane
  clipping
- Save current camera settings (and restore)
  


pyFormex 0.8.5  Releasenotes
============================

This is a collection of the most prominent changes in pyFormex 0.8.5
compared to the previous release 0.8.4. Like always, besides the new
things mentioned below, we also have lots of bug fixes, code cleanup
and functionality enhancements.



Documentation
-------------
- The official documentation is now on the new website at
  http://www.nongnu.org/pyformex/doc/index.html


Installation
------------
- The post-install script will normally not need to run pyformex, easing
  the installation in sandboxed environments.


Command line
------------


Configuration
-------------


Core
----
- coords: new Coords methods: average, inertia, centered; 
  new class BoundVectors; new functions pattern and xpattern
- formex: the pattern and mpattern functions are replaced by the functions 
  pattern and xpattern in the coords module. Some functions are provided 
  for compatibility, but users are urged to transform their code to the 
  new conventions.
- geomtools: new functions pointsAtLines, pointsAtSegments, distancesPFL, 
  distancesPFS; mode parameter to intersection* functions
- Mesh: new methods: partitionByAngle, avgNodes, removeDuplicate, enhanced
  and unified connect, extrude and revolve methods

Gui
---
- canvas background can have a horizontal grading
- more configuration settings can be changed from the GUI

Widgets
-------


Drawing
-------
- faster drawing of large lists
- improved Nurbs drawing

Scripting
---------


Plugin menus
------------
- geometry_menu: added(moved) some functionality from Surface menu,
  added (some) DXF import


Plugins
-------
- curve: Curve.endpoints method; Arc (enhanced) and Line (new) classes,
  PolyLine concatenation (append), BezierSpline.toMesh
- dxf: added import of some entities from .DXF files: Line, Polyline, Arc

External
--------
- a new program *dxfparser* is provided to import (parts of) .DXF files.
- pyformex-search script for searching the pyFormex source
