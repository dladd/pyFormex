  pattern and xpattern in the coords module. Some functions are provided 
  for compatibility, but users are urged to transform their code to the 
  new conventions.
- geomtools: new functions pointsAtLines, pointsAtSegments, distancesPFL, 
  distancesPFS; mode parameter to intersection* functions
- Mesh: new methods: partitionByAngle, avgNodes, removeDuplicate, enhanced
  and unified connect, extrude and revolve methods
