pyFormex 0.9.0  Releasenotes
============================

This is a collection of the most prominent changes in pyFormex 0.9.0
compared to release 0.8.8. The 0.8.9 release was nearly identical to
0.8.8 (mostly fixing some bugs).

Most important new things:

- pyFormex source is now in a git repository
- WebGL export
- PySide as Python bindings for Qt4
- DICOM images can be imported
- marching cubes algorithm
- VTK, VMTK interfaces
- fullscreen mode


Installation
------------
- installation of development version using git::

    git clone git://git.savannah.nongnu.org/pyformex.git

- pyFormex now also works with PySide as alternative for PyQt4.
  PySide is another set of Python bindings for Qt4


Gui
---

- Pressing F5 activates fullscreen mode, showing only the OpenGL canvas
  on the full screen. In fullscreen mode, mouse manipulations of the model
  remain possible. Another F5 press switch back to normal (window) mode.


Command line
------------


Core
----
- GeomFile: pyFormex pgf format now allows binary format
- Mesh.peel: peels element from the border
- arraytools: checkFloat, checkInt, pprint
- direct export/import of binary STL files
- export/import STL files with color
- some external commands can be run parallel


Drawing
-------
- Camera: provide correct camera position
- Geometric objects can get attributes set that will be honored on drawing.
  Currently: caption, color, opacity, visible


Scripting
---------
- pause and sleep functions improved
- new mkdir and pwdir functions, changed chdir


Widgets
-------
- new input items: InputFile, InputTable
- Array and Table widgets can be edited


Plugin menus
------------


Plugins
-------
- imagearray: now also reads (stacks of) DICOM images
- isosurface: construct 3D surface from 2D images, including marching cubes
  algorithm
- WebGL: new plugin allowing to create and export WebGL models directly
  from pyFormex. WebGL models can directly be viewed in 3D with a browser
  supporting WebGL (firefox, chrome).
- ccxinp: input of Calculix and Abaqus .inp files
- curve: PolyLine.movingFrenet computes Frenet frame along curve.
- vtk_itf and vmtk_itf: interfaces with vtk and vmtk

Extra
-----


Examples
--------
- WebGL example
