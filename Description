pyFormex is a program for generating, transforming and manipulating large
geometrical models of 3D structures by sequences of mathematical operations.
Thanks to a powerful (Python based) scripting language, pyFormex is very well
suited for the automated design of spatial structures. It provides a wide
range of operations on surface meshes, like STL type triangulated surfaces.
There are provisions to import medical scan images. pyFormex can also be used
as a pre- and post-processor for Finite Element analysis programs. Finally, it
might be used just for creating some nice graphics. Because the geometrical
models are built from a script, automation and creation of parametrized models
is a natural thing in pyFormex.
