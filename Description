pyFormex is a tool for generating, manipulating and operating on 
large geometrical models of 3D structures by sequences of mathematical
transformations.
A powerful scripting language provides operations for handling both wireframe and surface geometries.

pyFormex is easily extendible, usable in automated and parametric design,
and can readibly be linked to many other programs.

While still under development, it already provides many features for 
professional application.
