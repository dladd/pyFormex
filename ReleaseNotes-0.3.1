Detailed (though incomplete) changes since Release 0.3.1:
=========================================================

pyformex command
----------------
- An new option --nosplash prevents display of the startup message on the canvas.

pyformex GUI
------------
- Settings->Save Preferences: saves the preferences on demand


formex.py
---------
- distanceFromPlane(f,p,n) : calculates distance of points to a plane


Formex class:
-------------
- Clipping functions:
 where(self,nodes='all',dir=0,xmin=None,xmax=None)
 clip(w)
 cclip(w)


draw.py:
--------


canvas.py:
----------
canvas has a setBgColor method to set the background color


camera.py:
----------
changes needed by upgrade to numpy 0.9.8
 

mydict.py:
----------
The __repr__ and __str__ functions of the Dict and CascadingDict classes have
been reworked to provide sensible/clean output:
__repr__ (formatting with %r) will result in a string that is valid Python
to recreate the object, for both Dict and CascadingDict.
__str__ (formatting with %s) is equivalent to __repr__ for the Dict class, but
results in a nicely cascading format for the CascadingDict 


Experimental/Development 
========================
These files hold new and experimental functions. Their contents may be moved
to other files in future releases.


- properties.py :

- file2formex.py: 

- stl.py: 
   write_ascii(a,f) now writes unit-length normals

- simple.py:
   unitcircle: defines circles as Formex structure
