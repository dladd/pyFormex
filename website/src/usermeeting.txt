A number of pyFormex users and developers at `IBiTech`_ has taken the initiative to gather at regular intervals to discuss the use and future development of pyFormex. 

These meetings are held approximately monthly at the `IBiTech`_ institute and
will be announced on the website.

All pyFormex users are welcome.

The minutes of the meetings are available from our `anonymous FTP`_ server.
