About
-----
pyFormex is a program for generating, transforming and manipulating large
geometrical models of 3D structures by sequences of mathematical 
operations. Thanks to a powerful (Python based) scripting language,
pyFormex is very well suited for the automated design of spatial frame
structures. It provides a wide range of operations on surface meshes, 
like STL type triangulated surfaces. There are provisions to import medical 
scan images. pyFormex can also be used as a pre- and post-processor for 
Finite Element analysis programs. Finally, it might be used just for 
creating some nice graphics.

Using pyFormex, the topology of the elements and the final geometrical form
can be decoupled. Often, topology is created first and then mapped onto the
geometry. Through the scripting language, the user can define any sequence
of transformations, built from provided or user defined functions. 
This way, building parametric models becomes a natural thing.

While pyFormex is still under `development`_, it already provides a fairly stable scripting language and an OpenGL GUI environment for displaying and manipulating the generated structures.

Prerequisites
-------------
If you only want to use the Formex class, its mathematical transformation methods and scripting, without a Graphical User Interface(GUI), all you need is recent versions of `Python`_ and `NumPy`_. 

If you want to use the Graphical User Interface to run scripts and to render the created structures either to screen or to image files, you also need `PyOpenGL`_, `Qt4`_ and `PyQt4`_.
  
Full details are in the documentation.
  
  
Platform
--------
pyFormex is written completely in Python. While it is developed on GNU/Linux platforms, it can be made to work on other platforms too, provided that you have installed the required packages.
  
  
Options
-------
There are some optional packages you can install to enhance some of the functionality of pyFormex.

- If you want to save the images in .PS, .EPS or .PDF format (as shown in the WireStent example), you need the gl2ps OpenGL to PostScript printing library.
- If you want to perform the structural analysis of the truss in the X_truss_analysis example, you need the `Calpy`_ analysis package. Install by preference from the source; compiling should work without problems if you have a full NumPy installation.
