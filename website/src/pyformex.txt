  <h2>About</h2>
  
  <p>A Python implementation of Formex algebra.</p>
  <p>pyFormex is a tool for generating, manipulating and operating on large geometrical models of 3D structures by sequences of mathematical 	transformations.</p>
  <p>It is especially suited for the automated design of spatial frame structures. But as the examples show,
  it can also be used for other tasks, like finite element preprocessing, or just for creating some nice pictures.
  pyFormex also offers interesting possibilities for executing specialized operations on surface meshes, usually STL type triangulated meshes 	originating from CT or MRI images.</p>

  <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
  <p>If you only want to use the Formex class, its mathematical transformation methods and scripting, without a Graphical User Interface(GUI), all you 	need is recent versions of <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> and <a href="http://numpy.scipy.org//" target="blank">NumPy</a>	</p>
  <p>If you want to use the Graphical User Interface to run scripts and to render the created structures either to screen or to image files, you also 	need <a href="http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/">PyOpenGL</a>, <a href="http://trolltech.com/products/qt" target="blank">Qt4</a> and <a 	href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/" target="blank">PyQt4</a></p>
  <p>Full details are in the documentation.</p>
  
  
  <a name="Platform"/>
  <h2>Platform</h2>
  <p>pyFormex is written completely in Python. While it is developed on Linux platforms, it can be made to work on other platforms too, provided you 	have installed the required packages.</p>
  
  
  <a name="Options"/>
  <h2>Optional packages</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>If you want to save the images in .PS, .EPS or .PDF format (as shown in the WireStent example), you need the gl2ps OpenGL to PostScript 	printing library.</li>
    <li>If you want to perform the structural analysis of the truss in the X_truss_analysis example, you need the <a 	href="ftp://bumps.ugent.be/pub/calpy/">calpy</a> analysis package version 0.3.4 or higher. Install by preference from the source; 	compiling should work without problems if you have a full NumPy installation.</li>
  </ul>
