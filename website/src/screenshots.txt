- `Stent unroll procedure`_: This screenshot shows four stages in the
  evaluation of the geometry of a stent device.
- `Transparency`_: The transparent mode can be useful for many
  applications, such as the one shown in this screenshot. By using the
  transparent mode, it is possible to visualize the complete stent
  structure, which is implanted in a diseased artery.
- `Wire stent`_: This screenshot shows the main stages during the
  generation of the wire stent geometry.
- `Surface mesh manipulations`_: The top viewports show a stent device
  (acquired from CT scan images) in smooth rendering. At the bottom,
  some cross section are shown which have been created with pyFormex.
- `Fluid simulations`_: pyFormex can also be used to create grids for
  Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Again, many parameters can
  easily be modified (angle of intersection, number of boundary
  layers,...).
- `Slicing operation`_: In this example pyFormex was used to slice a
  surface model of a Horse. From left to right and top to bottom: the
  original surface, 40 slices in the x-direction, 50 slices in the
  direction of the (x,y)-bisector, and 100 slices in the
  z-direction. Operations like these could e.g. be used to create
  models for rapid prototyping..

Some other screenshots can be found `here`_ on the developer pages.

And here we have some images of pyFormex running on ARM-based hardware:

- `efika_smartbook`_: A Genesi Efika MX Smartbook running pyFormex.
- `efika_screenshot`_: Screenshot of the Genesi Efika running pyFormex
  under Ubuntu 10.10.
