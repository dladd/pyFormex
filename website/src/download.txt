Download pyFormex
-----------------
You can get pyFormex from one of the following sources:

- `Official releases`_ are distributed from the developer site. For most users this is the prefered way to get pyFormex.

- If you need (or want to test) new features that are not yet in the official release, you may try one of the pre-releases of the upcoming next release. The `latest`_ is usually available from the project's `FTP site`_, while our `local FTP server`_ contains a collection of both newer and older releases.

- If the packed releases do not work for you, or you need the latest features not yet available in a release, you can always install the pyFormex source file repository. The `SVN repository`_ on the developer site is accessible by anonymous SVN. The command ``svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/pyformex/trunk`` will checkout the source to a local directory ``trunk``. Provided you have all the prerequisites installed, pyFormex can then be run directly from the checked out source: ``trunk/pyformex/pyformex``. If you want to use the compiled accelerator library however, you will have to create it first: ``cd trunk/pyformex/lib; ./configure; make`` should do it.


- Finally, if you can not install all the prerequisites but still would like to try out the program, you can run pyFormex directly from the `BuMPix Linux Live`_. This is a full Linux distribution that you can run directly from CD or USB media, without the need to install anything. Just carry your USB-stick with you, and you can run pyFormex anywhere you find an available computer.
