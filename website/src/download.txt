Download pyFormex
-----------------  
You can get pyFormex from one of the following sources:
  
.. _`Official releases`: http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2717
.. _`local FTP server`: ftp://bumps.ugent.be/pub/pyformex
.. _`the project's FTP site`: ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/pyformex
.. _`SVN repository`: http://developer.berlios.de/svn/?group_id=2717
.. _`BuMPix Linux Live CD`: ftp://bumps.ugent.be/pub/bumpix


- `Official releases`_ are distributed from the developer site. For most users this is the prefered way get pyFormex.

- If you need (or want to test) new features that are not yet in the official release, you may try one of the pre-releases of the upcoming next release. The latest is usually available from `the project's FTP site`_, while our `local FTP server`_ contains a collection of latest and older releases.

- If the packed releases do not work for you, or you need the latest features not yet available in a release, you can always install the pyFormex source files. The `SVN repository`_ on the developer site is accessible by anonymous SVN.

- Finally, if you can not install all the prerequisites but still would like to try out the program, you can run pyFormex directly from the `BuMPix Linux Live CD`_.
