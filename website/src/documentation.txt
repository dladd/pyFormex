Documentation
-------------  

*The pyFormex documentation is currently being restructured, rewritten
and expanded. While we already provide a preview of the upcoming new
documentation, we will also offer the old manual until the transformation
has been finalized.*

- Preview of the new `pyFormex documentation`_ under development. 

  - The `Introduction to pyFormex`_, `Installing pyFormex`_, `pyFormex
    tutorial`_ and `pyFormex reference manual`_ are already fairly complete
    and useable. 
  - The `pyFormex user guide`_ and `pyFormex examples`_ are still very limited. 

- The older pyFormex manual (version 0.8):

  - Browse the `Online manual`_ (a local version is accessible from inside the pyFormex GUI).
  - Download `PDF-version`_ of the manual.
