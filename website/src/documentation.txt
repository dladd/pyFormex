Documentation
-------------  

*The pyFormex documentation is currently being restructured, rewritten
and expanded. While we already provide a preview of the upcoming new
documentation, you might still be better off with the old manual.*

- Preview of the new `pyFormex documentation`_ under development. 


- The older pyFormex manual (version 0.8):

  - Browse the `Online manual`_ (a local version is accessible from inside the pyFormex GUI).
  - Download `PDF-version`_ of the manual.
