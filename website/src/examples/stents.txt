Creating stent geometries
=========================

Wire stent
----------

The image shows a single layered (top) and a double layered (bottom)
wire stent in line model. Both were generated by the script below.

{colorize;../scripts/wirestent.py} 


Wire stent in surface model
---------------------------

By sweeping a circular contour along (some of) the wires of the previous
example, a surface mesh of the wires can be obtained.

   :align: center

Balloon expandable stent
------------------------

pyFormex can be used for the parametric design of balloon expandable
stents. As illustrated below, both the geometric design and the mesh
can easily be modified.
