Postprocessing
==============

The pyFormex rendering machine can be used to render any scalar value
on a given geomatry. Thus pyFormex can also be used as a postprocessor for
numerical simulation codes such as Finite Element Analysis (FEA) or
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).

Distance
--------

This image renders the distance from all points of the
geometry to a single fixed point. The imagewas taken in an alpha version of pyFormex 0.6.1.

FE results
----------

In this image from pyFormex 0.8.1 (alpha) multiple viewports are used
to render some results from FEA simulations. Also shown is the
postprocessing user dialog.
