Postprocessing
==============
The pyFormex rendering machine can be used to render any scalar value on a given geomatry. Thus pyFormex can be used as a postprocessor for numerical simulation codes such as FEA or CFD. The image below shows the result of such a rendering in an alpha version of pyFormex 0.6.1.


Distance
--------
This image renders the distance of all points of the geometry to a single fixed point.
