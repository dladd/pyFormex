Creating spatial structures
===========================
  
Hesperia dome
-------------

The Hesperia dome is a enormous construction made of glass on top of a
hotel in Barcelona. With pyFormex, a parametric 3D model of this dome
was created which allowed to evaluate geometric variations changing one
or more parameters (e.g. the span or height of a dome, the amount of
secondary triangles, etc.) as shown in the figure below. As
illustrated, geometries can be displayed in several ways
(e.g. wireframe, flat, smooth, transparent). Automated generation of
finite element input files can be incorporated in pyFormex.

Hyparcap

Scallop dome
------------

Example showing the parametric capabilities of pyFormex. Both domes
are createdby the same small script, by only changing two parameters.

Geodesic Dome
-------------

This example illustrates the use of surface elements. It shows four
steps in the creation of a geodesic dome.

.. image:: ../images/Geodesic-1.png

First we create two triangles. We give them different colors so that
they are easy to distinguish::

   v=0.5*sqrt(3.)
   a = Formex([[[0,0],[1,0],[0.5,v]]],1)
   aa = Formex([[[1,0],[1.5,v],[0.5,v]]],2)

.. image:: ../images/Geodesic-2.png

Next we copy the triangles a number of times in two directions,
generating the triangular pattern at the left::

   m=5; n=5
   d = a.replic2(m,min(m,n),1.,v,bias=0.5,taper=-1)
   dd = aa.replic2(m-1,min(m-1,n),1.,v,bias=0.5,taper=-1)

.. image:: ../images/Geodesic-3.png

Then we copy-rotate the pattern into a hexagon::

    e = (d+dd).rosette(6,60,point=[m*0.5,m*v,0])

.. image:: ../images/Geodesic-4.png

Lastly the pattern is mapped on a sphere, resulting in a geodesic dome
from which we give a perspective view::

   f = e.mapd(2,lambda d:0.8*sqrt((m+1)**2-d**2),e.center(),[0,1]) 

.. End
