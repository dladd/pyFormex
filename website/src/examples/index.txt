- `Creating Geometry`_: This page may give you a nice idea of what you can do with pyFormex. The examples are taken from the extensive set included with the distribution.

- `Operations on surface meshes`_: We have frequently used pyFormex for performing specialized operations on surface meshes, like STL type triangulated meshes originating from medical scan (CT) images. Some of the developed algorithms have already been included in pyFormex. This page shows some examples of their use.

- `Illustrations`_: pyFormex can not only be used to create 3D geometry or operate on surface meshes. This page shows some examples where it was used just to create nice images.

- `Post-processing`_: pyFormex can be used as a postprocessor for numerical simulation codes such as FEA or CFD.
