-------

This gallery is a collection of screenshots, illustrated examples,
videos and PDF documents of pyFormex setup and use in education and
research.

These documents have been collected over the past years of pyFormex
development and do not necessarily correspond to the latest version.
They may however still give you a good (though limited) impression of
what pyFormex can do for you.

....................
The pyFormex distribution (see the `Install manual <doc/install.html>`_) 
contains a wide collection of example scripts, 
with levels ranging from beginner to
advanced. Running these examples gives a nice overview of some
functionalities of pyFormex. 

As an extra bonus, here's a movie of a roof structure created by
pyFormex. 
Click the reload button of your browser to see the movie play (again).
