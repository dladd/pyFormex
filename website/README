#
# This directory is used for building the pyFormex web pages.
# 
# The static html pages (in the html subdirectory) should not be edited
# directly. They are built from the source files (in src) using rest2web 
# (http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/rest2web/)
# You need to install this software if you want to change the source files
# and rebuild the pages. (On Debian:  apt-get install rest2web)
# The html pages are built by executing the command 'r2w' in this directory.
#
# Being automatically build, the html pages should not be added to the
# repository.
#
# All images used in the pages should be put in the images subdir.
#

#
# !!! You may need to apply a patch to rest2web to get the proper working !!!
#
# The patch is in the file rest2web.diff in this directory. To apply it, 
# proceed as follows (you will likely need root permissions):
# - find out were rest2web is installed 
#   (Debian: /usr/share/python-support/rest2web/rest2web)
# - go to that directory: there should be a file restindex.py
# - give the following command:
# patch < full_path_to_the_rest2web.diff
# (You can add a --dry-run option first to check out if it works, 
# without actually making the changes.)
