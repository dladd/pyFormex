Preamble
********


These documents are to become a full documentation and manual for the 
|pyformex| software. However, as |pyformex| is a still under active
development, so is this documentation: it therefore is by no means final and
complete; it does not even pretend to be accurate for any version of |pyformex|.

However, since partial documentation is better than none, we decided to make 
this preliminary version available to the general public, to ease the use
of |pyformex|. 

This document may evolve fast, so check back regularly. Besides being available
from the `pyFormex website`_, you will probably find a version in your local
|pyformex| installation (if you've installed the program already). 
Most of the reference manual is generated automatically from the docstrings in
the source code, so that information is usually the most reliable.

The contributors to this manual are: Benedict Verhegghe, Tim Neels, Matthieu De Beule and Peter Mortier.
