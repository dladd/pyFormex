Introduction to |pyformex|
**************************

.. topic:: Abstract

   This part explains shortly what |pyformex| is and what it is not.
   It sets the conditions under which you are allowed to use, modify and
   distribute the program. 
   Next is a list of prerequisite software parts that you need to have
   installed in order to be able to run this program. 
   We explain how to download and install |pyformex|. 
   Finally, you'll find out what basic knowledge you should have in order
   to understand the tutorial and succesfully use |pyformex|.

What is |pyformex|?
===================

You probably expect to find here a short definition of what |pyformex| is and
what it can do for you. I may have to disappoint you: describing the essence
of |pyformex| in a few lines is not an easy task to do, because the program can
be (and is being) used for very different tasks. 
So I will give you two answers here: a short one and a long one.

The short answer is that |pyformex| is a program to 
*generate large structured sets of coordinates by means of subsequent 
mathematical transformations gathered in a script.* 
If you find this definition too dull, incomprehensible or just not
descriptive enough, read on through this section and look at some of the
examples in this documentation and on the `pyFormex website`_. 
You will then probably have a better idea of what |pyformex| is.

The initial intent of |pyformex| was the rapid design of three-dimensional
structures with a geometry that can easier be obtained through mathematical
description than through interactive generation of its subparts and
assemblage thereof. Although the initial development of the program
concentrated mostly on wireframe type structures, surface and solid elements
have been part of |pyformex| right from the beginning.
There is already an extensive plugin for working with triangulated surfaces, 
and |pyformex| is increasingly being used to generate solid meshes of
structures. 
Still, many of the examples included with the |pyformex| distribution are of
wireframe type, and so are most of the examples in the :doc:`tutorial`.

A good illustration of what |pyformex| can do and what it was intended for is 
the stent [#]_ structure in the figure :ref:`fig:wirestent-example`. 
It is one of the many examples provided with |pyformex|.

   :align: center
   :alt: A wire stent

   WireStent example

The structure is composed of 22032 line segments, each defined by 2 points.
Nobody in his right mind would ever even try to input all the 132192 coordinates
of all the points describing that structure.  
With |pyformex|, one could define the structure by the following sequence of
operations, illustrated in the figure :ref:`fig:wirestent-steps`:

#. Create a nearly planar base module of two crossing wires. The wires have a
   slight out-of-plane bend, to enable the crossing.
#. Extend the base module with a mirrored and translated copy.
#. Replicate the base module in both directions of the base plane.
#. Roll the planar grid into a cylinder.

|pyformex| provides all the operations needed to define the geometry in this
way.

   First three steps in building the WireStent example

|pyformex| does not fit into a single category of traditional (mostly 
commercial) software packages, because it is not being developed as a 
program with a specific purpose, but rather as a collection of tools 
and scripts which we needed at some point in our research projects.
Many of the tasks for which we now use |pyformex| could be
done also with some other software package, like a CAD program or a matrix
calculation package or a solid modeler/renderer or a finite element pre- and
postprocessor. Each of these is probably very well suited for the task
it was designed for, but none provides all the features of |pyformex|
in a single consistent environment, and certainly not as free software.

Perhaps the most important feature of |pyformex| is that it was primarily
intended to be an easy scripting language for creating geometrical models
of 3D-structures. The Graphical User Interface was only added as a convenient
means to visualize the designed structure.
|pyformex| can still run without user interface, and this makes it ideal
for use in a batch toolchain. Anybody involved in the simulation of the
mechanical behaviour of materials and structures will testify that most of the
work (often 80-90%) goes into the building of the model, not into the
simulations itself. Repeatedly building a model for optimization of your
structure quickly becomes cumbersome, unless you use a tool like |pyformex|,
allowing for automated and unattended building of model variants.

The author of  |pyformex|, professor in structural engineering and heavy
computer user and programmer since mainframe times, deeply regrets that
computing skills
of nowadays engineering students are often limited to using graphical
interfaces of mostly commercial packages.
This greatly limits their skills, because in their way of thinking: 
'If there is no menu item to do some task, then it can not be done!'
The hope to get some of them back into coding has been a stimulus in
continuing our work on |pyformex|. The strength of the scripting language
and the elegance of Python have already attracted many users on this path.

Finally, |pyformex| is, and will always be, free software in both meanings
of free: guaranteeing the freedom of the user (see :ref:`sec:license`) and
without charging a fee for it. [#]_

.. _sec:installation:

Installation
============

Information on how to obtain and install |pyformex| can be found in the :doc:`install` document.


.. _sec:using:

Using |pyformex|
================

Once you have installed and want to start using |pyformex|, you will probably
be looking for help on how to do it.

If you are new to |pyformex|, you should start with the :doc:`tutorial`, which
will guide you step by step, using short examples, through the basic concepts
of Python, NumPy and |pyFormex|. You have to understand there is a lot to learn
at first, but afterwards the rewards will prove to be huge. You can skip the
sections on Python and NumPy if you already have some experience with it.

If you have used |pyformex| before or you are of the adventurous type that does
not want to be told where to go and how to do it, skip the tutorial and go 
directly to the :doc:`user-guide`. It provide the most thorough information
of all aspects of |pyformex|


Getting Help
============

If you get stuck somewhere with using (or installing) |pyformex| and you
need help, the best way is to go to the `pyFormex website`_ and ask for help
on one of the `Forums`_. There's a good change you will get helped quickly
there. Remember though that |pyformex| is a free and open source software
project and its developers are not paid to develop or maintain |pyformex|, 
they just do this because they find |pyformex| very helpful in their normal
daily activities. 

If you are a professional |pyformex| user and required guaranteed support,
you can check with `FEops`_, a young company providing services with and
support for |pyformex|.
