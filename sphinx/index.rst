pyFormex Documentation
######################

This is the pyFormex |release| documentation, last updated on |today|.

.. warning:: We have moved to a new documentation management system
   (`Sphinx`_) and are currently in the process of rewriting the
   documentation. This means that some of these documents are in a
   rather unstable condition and may evolve quickly. The :doc:`intro`,
   :doc:`install`, :doc:`tutorial` and :doc:`refman` are already fairly
   complete and useable. The :doc:`user-guide` and :doc:`examples` are
   still in an embryonal state but may already contain valuable information
   for some users.
  
   A `PDF version`_ of the full documentation set is available for
   download from our FTP server.


These documents are to become a full documentation set for the
installation and use of the pyFormex software. However, as pyFormex is
still under active development, so is this documentation: it therefore
is by no means final and complete; it does not even pretend to be
accurate for any version of pyFormex.

However, since partial documentation is better than none, we decided
to make this preliminary version available to the general public, to
ease the use of pyFormex. The :doc:`refman` is automatically generated
from the docstrings in the Python source, so this might best reflect
the latest development version of the software.

The new documentation is currently only available in HTML format.
