pyFormex Documentation
######################

This is the pyFormex |release| documentation, last updated on |today|.

These documents are to become a full documentation set for the
installation and use of the `pyFormex`_ software. However, as pyFormex is
still under active `development`_, so is this documentation: it therefore
is by no means final and complete; it does not even pretend to be
accurate for any version of pyFormex.

However, since partial documentation is better than none, we decided
to make this preliminary version available to the general public, to
ease the use of pyFormex. The :doc:`refman` is automatically generated
from the docstrings in the Python source, so that might best reflect
the latest development version of the software. The :doc:`intro`,
:doc:`install`, :doc:`tutorial` are also fairly complete and useable.
The :doc:`user-guide` and :doc:`examples` are still in an embryonal
state but may already contain valuable information for some users.

The new documentation is available in HTML format for interactive
browsing. A `PDF version`_ of the full documentation set can be downloaded
from our FTP server. From the pyFormex GUI, a local version of the 
HTML documentation may be accessible from the **Help** menu.
