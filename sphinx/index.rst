========================
|pyformex| documentation
========================

This is the |pyformex| |release| documentation, last updated on |today|.

.. warning:: We have moved to a new documentation management
   system and are currently in the process of rewriting the
   documentation. This means that some of these documents are in a rather
   unstable condition and may evolve quickly. 

These documents are to become a full documentation set for the installation and use of the |pyformex| software. However, as |pyformex| is still under active
development, so is this documentation: it therefore is by no means final and
complete; it does not even pretend to be accurate for any version of |pyformex|.

However, since partial documentation is better than none, we decided to make 
this preliminary version available to the general public, to ease the use
of |pyformex|. The :doc:`refman` is automatically generated from the docstrings
in the Python source, so this might best reflect the latest development version of the software.

Some older versions of the documentation may be available in PDF format from
the `pyFormex website`_. You should also find a version in your local
|pyformex| installation.
