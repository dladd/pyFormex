.. topic:: Abstract

  This chapter explains how to use projects to make your work
  persistent. We will explain how to create new projects,
  how to add or remove data from the project and how to save and
  reopen project files.

.. _sec:projects_what:

What is a project
=================

A pyFormex project is a persistent copy of some data created by
pyFormex. These data are saved in a project file, which you can later
re-open to import the data in another pyFormex session.
