.. _sec:nogui:

Running without the GUI
=======================

If you start with the --nogui option, no Graphical User Interface is created.
This is extremely useful to run automated scripts in batch mode. In this
operating mode, will interprete all arguments remaining after interpreting the
options, as filenames of scripts to be run (and possibly arguments to be
interpreted by these scripts). Thus, if you want to run a script myscript.py in
batch mode, just give the command pyformex myscript.py.

The running script has access to the remaining arguments in the global list
variable *argv*. The script can use any arguments of it and pop them of the
list. Any arguments remaining in the *argv* list when the script finishes, will
be used for another execution cycle. This means that the first remaining
argument should again be a script.
