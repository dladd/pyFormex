Collection of changes since pyFormex release 0.4
================================================
- config.py:
  Configuration files now can have continuation lines, flagged by \

GUI:
====
- image saving:
   - option settings gathered in a single dialog
   - auto mode saves a new image at each draw() operation
   - option to save full pyFormex window

- when starting multiple pyFormex instances, windows are named differently 

- user menus (see Stl.py and Formex.py examples)

- appearance dialog to set the widget Style and Font 

- toggle between perspective/projective display now works


- Formex class:
  - setProp has no longer a default value. If called with a value None,
    the property numbers are removed.
  - removeProp is deprecated: replace with setProp(None)

  - translate and translate1 have been merged into a single function

  - shrink(factor) shrinks all elements in the Formex by a factor

  - fixed the bug in connect() when loop=True and bias != 0

  - interpolate (F,G,[v]) : interpolates between Formices F and G at values v

  - divide(a,[v]) : divide all elements of a plex-2 Formex at values v



- draw.py:
  - draw(F) now also accepts a string. If it is the name of an object in
    globals(), that object is drawn.
  - all Formices created during the run of a script are now exported by default
    This can be undone by setting GD.cfg['autoglobals'] to False
  - flyAlong (path): move the camera along path. Each element of path is a 
    couple of two points : camera position and point to look at. 
    In autosave mode an image is saved at each camera position.


- widgets.py:
  - added Selection dialog to select items from a list
  - renamed InputDialog.process() to getResult() for consistency


- Manual:
  - installation instructions
  - Some additions to reference manual


KNOWN PROBLEMS:
--------------
 - With the mouse zoom function, you can not zoom beyond the center of the
   displayed scene. (You can do it using the zoom buttons)
 - Mouse zooming does not work correctly in projective mode.
 - Mouse zooming will make a jump after a flyAlong().
