pyFormex is a tool for generating, manipulating and transforming large
geometrical models of 3D structures by sequences of mathematical 
transformations. Thanks to a powerful (Python based) scripting language,
pyFormex is very well suited for the automated design of spatial frame
structures. It provides a wide range of operations on surface meshes, 
like STL type triangulated surfaces. There are provisions to import medical 
scan images. pyFormex can also be used as a pre- and post-processor for 
Finite Element analysis programs. Finally, it might be used just for 
creating some nice graphics.

Using pyFormex, the topology of the elements and the final geometrical form
can be decoupled. Often, topology is created first and then mapped onto the
geometry. Through the scripting language, the user can define any sequence
of transformations, built from provided or user defined functions. 
This way, building parametric models becomes a natural thing.

While pyFormex is still under development (http://pyformex.berlios.de), 
it already provides a fairly stable scripting language and an OpenGL GUI
environment for displaying and manipulating the generated structures.
