class DoubleHelixStent:
    """Constructs a double helix wire stent.

    A stent is a tubular shape such as used for opening obstructed
    blood vessels. This stent is made frome sets of wires spiraling
    in two directions.
    The geometry is defined by the following parameters:
      L  : length of the stent
      De : external diameter of the stent 
      D  : average stent diameter
      d  : wire diameter
      be : pitch angle (degrees)
      p  : pitch  
      nx : number of wires in one spiral set
      ny : number of modules in axial direction
      ds : extra distance between the wires (default is 0.0 for
           touching wires)
      dz : maximal distance of wire center to average cilinder
      nb : number of elements in a strut (a part of a wire between two
           crossings), default 4
    The stent is created around the z-axis. 
    By default, there will be connectors between the wires at each
    crossing. They can be switched off in the constructor.
    The returned formex has one set of wires with property 1, the
    other with property 3. The connectors have property 2. The wire
    set with property 1 is winding positively around the z-axis.
