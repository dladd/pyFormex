The draw module provides the basic user interface to the OpenGL
rendering capabilities of pyFOrmex.

\emph{Warning: the \texttt{draw} module is still subject to regular changes.
Therefore, the information given below may not be fully accurate.

\begin{funcdesc}{ask}{question,choices=None,default=None}
Ask a question and present possible answers.

    Return answer if accepted or default if rejected.
    The remaining arguments are passed to the InputDialog getResult method.
    

\end{funcdesc}


\begin{funcdesc}{ack}{question}
Show a Yes/No question and return True/False depending on answer.

\end{funcdesc}


\begin{funcdesc}{error}{message,actions=['OK']}
Show an error message and wait for user acknowledgement.

\end{funcdesc}


\begin{funcdesc}{warning}{message,actions=['OK']}
Show a warning message and wait for user acknowledgement.

\end{funcdesc}


\begin{funcdesc}{showInfo}{message,actions=['OK']}
Show a neutral message and wait for user acknowledgement.

\end{funcdesc}


\begin{funcdesc}{showText}{text,type=None,actions=['OK']}
Display a text and wait for user response.

    This can display a large text and will add scrollbars when needed.
    

\end{funcdesc}


\begin{funcdesc}{showFile}{filename}


\end{funcdesc}


\begin{funcdesc}{askItems}{items,caption=None}
Ask the value of some items to the user.

    Create an interactive widget to let the user set the value of some items.
    Input is a list of input items (basically [key,value] pairs).
    See the widgets.InputDialog class for complete description of the
    available input items.

    The remaining arguments are keyword arguments that are passed to the
    InputDialog.getResult method.
    A timeout (in seconds) can be specified to have the input dialog
    interrupted automatically.

    Return a dictionary with the results: for each input item there is a
    (key,value) pair. Returns an empty dictionary if the dialog was canceled.
    Sets the dialog timeout and accepted status in global variables.
    

\end{funcdesc}


\begin{funcdesc}{dialogTimedOut}{}
Returns True if the last askItems() dialog timed out.

\end{funcdesc}


\begin{funcdesc}{dialogAccepted}{}
Returns True if the last askItems() dialog was accepted.

\end{funcdesc}


\begin{funcdesc}{askFilename}{cur=None,filter="All files (*.*)",exist=False,multi=False}
Ask for a file name or multiple file names using a file dialog.

    cur is a directory or filename. All the files matching the filter in that
    directory (or that file's directory) will be shown.
    If cur is a file, it will be selected as the current filename.
    

\end{funcdesc}


\begin{funcdesc}{askDirname}{cur=None}
Ask for an existing directory name.

    cur is a directory. All the directories in that directory will
    initially be shown.
    

\end{funcdesc}


\begin{funcdesc}{log}{s}
Display a message in the cmdlog window.

\end{funcdesc}


\begin{funcdesc}{draw}{F,view=None,bbox=None,color='prop',colormap=None,alpha=0.5,mode=None,linewidth=None,shrink=None,marksize=None,wait=True,clear=None,allviews=False}
Draw object(s) with specified settings and direct camera to it.

    The first argument is an object to be drawn. All other arguments are
    settings that influence how  the object is being drawn.

    F is either a Formex or a TriSurface object, or a name of such object
    (global or exported), or a list thereof.
    If F is a list, the draw() function is called repeatedly with each of
    ithe items of the list as first argument and with the remaining arguments
    unchanged.

    The remaining arguments are drawing options. If None, they are filled in
    from the current viewport drawing options.
    
    view is either the name of a defined view or 'last' or None.
    Predefined views are 'front','back','top','bottom','left','right','iso'.
    With view=None the camera settings remain unchanged (but might be changed
    interactively through the user interface). This may make the drawn object
    out of view!
    With view='last', the camera angles will be set to the same camera angles
    as in the last draw operation, undoing any interactive changes.
    The initial default view is 'front' (looking in the -z direction).

    bbox specifies the 3D volume at which the camera will be aimed (using the
    angles set by view). The camera position wil be set so that the volume
    comes in view using the current lens (default 45 degrees).
    bbox is a list of two points or compatible (array with shape (2,3)).
    Setting the bbox to a volume not enclosing the object may make the object
    invisible on the canvas.
    The special value bbox='auto' will use the bounding box of the objects
    getting drawn (object.bbox()), thus ensuring that the camera will focus
    on these objects.
    The special value bbox=None will use the bounding box of the previous
    drawing operation, thus ensuring that the camera's target volume remains
    unchanged.

    color,colormap,linewidth,alpha,marksize are passed to the
    creation of the 3D actor.

    shrink is a floating point shrink factor that will be applied to object
    before drawing it.

    If the Formex has properties and a color list is specified, then the
    the properties will be used as an index in the color list and each member
    will be drawn with the resulting color.
    If color is one color value, the whole Formex will be drawn with
    that color.
    Finally, if color=None is specified, the whole Formex is drawn in black.
    
    Each draw action activates a locking mechanism for the next draw action,
    which will only be allowed after drawdelay seconds have elapsed. This
    makes it easier to see subsequent images and is far more elegant that an
    explicit sleep() operation, because all script processing will continue
    up to the next drawing instruction.
    The value of drawdelay is set in the config, or 2 seconds by default.
    The user can disable the wait cycle for the next draw operation by
    specifying wait=False. Setting drawdelay=0 will disable the waiting
    mechanism for all subsequent draw statements (until set >0 again).

\begin{funcdesc}{setView}{name,angles=None}
Set the default view for future drawing operations.

    If no angles are specified, the name should be an existing view, or
    the predefined value 'last'.
    If angles are specified, this is equivalent to createView(name,angles)
    followed by setView(name).
    

\end{funcdesc}


\begin{funcdesc}{_shrink}{F,factor}
Return a shrinked object.

    A shrinked object is one where each element is shrinked with a factor
    around its own center.

    M is a list with the same length as X.
    The string representation of the marks are drawn at the corresponding
    3D coordinate.
    

\end{funcdesc}


\begin{funcdesc}{drawNumbers}{F,color='black',trl=None,offset=0}
Draw numbers on all elements of F.

    Normally, the numbers are drawn at the centroids of the elements.
    A translation may be given to put the numbers out of the centroids,
    e.g. to put them in front of the objects to make them visible,
    or to allow to view a mark at the centroids.
    If an offset is specified, it is added to the shown numbers.
    

\end{funcdesc}


\begin{funcdesc}{drawVertexNumbers}{F,color='black',trl=None}
Draw (local) numbers on all vertices of F.

    Normally, the numbers are drawn at the location of the vertices.
    A translation may be given to put the numbers out of the location,
    e.g. to put them in front of the objects to make them visible,
    or to allow to view a mark at the vertices.

\end{funcdesc}


\begin{funcdesc}{focus}{object}
Move the camera thus that object comes fully into view.

    object can be anything having a bbox() method.

    The camera is moved with fixed axis directions to a place
    where the whole object can be viewed using a 45. degrees lens opening.
    This technique may change in future!
    

\end{funcdesc}
