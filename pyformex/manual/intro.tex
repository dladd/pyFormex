This section explains shortly what \pyformex is and what it is not. It sets the conditions under which you are allowed to use, modify and distribute the program. Next is a list of prerequisite software parts that you need to have installed in order to be able to run this program. We explain how to download and install \pyformex. Finally, you'll find out what basic knowledge you should have in order to understand the tutorial and succesfully use \pyformex.

\section{What is \pyformex?}
\label{sec:what-pyformex}

You probably expect to find here a short definition of what \pyformex is and what it can do for you. I may have to disappoint you: describing the essence of \pyformex in a few lines is not an easy task to do, because the program can be (and is being) used for very different tasks. So I will give you two answers here: a short one and a long one.

The short answer is that \pyformex is a program to \emph{generate large structured sets of coordinates by means of subsequent mathematical transformations gathered in a script.}
If you find this definition too dull, incomprehensible or just not descriptive enough, read on through this section and look at some of the examples in this manual and on the \htmladdnormallinkfoot{\pyformex website}{\websiteURL}. You will then probably have a better idea of what \pyformex{} is. 

The initial intent of \pyformex was the rapid design of three-dimensional structures with a geometry that can easier be obtained through mathematical description than through interactive generation of its subparts and assemblage thereof. While during development of the program we have concentrated mostly on wireframe type structures, surface and solid elements have been part of \pyformex right from the beginning. Still, many of the examples included with \pyformex are of frame type and most of the practical use of the program is in this area. There is also an extensive plugin for working with triangulated surfaces.

The stent\footnote{A stent is a tube-shaped structure that is e.g. used to reopen (and keep open) obstructed blood vessels.} structure in the figure~\ref{fig:WireStent-example} is a good illustration of what \pyformex can do and what it was intended for. It is one of the many examples provided with \pyf.

  \end{htmlonly}  
  \caption{WireStent example.}   \label{fig:WireStent-example}

\end{figure}

The structure is composed of 22032 line segments, each defined by 2 points. Nobody in his right mind would ever even try to input all the 132192 coordinates of all the points describing that structure. 
With \pyformex, one could define the structure by the following sequence of operations, illustrated in the figure~\ref{fig:WireStent-steps}:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Create a nearly planar base module of two crossing wires. (The wires have a slight out-of-plane bend, to enable the crossing.) 
 \item Extend the base module with a mirrored and translated copy.
 \item Replicate the base module in both directions of the base plane.
 \item Roll the planar grid into a cylinder.
 \end{itemize}
\pyf provides all the needed operations to define the geometry in this way.

%\section{Rationale}
%\label{sec:rationale}
\pyformex does not fit into a single category of traditional (mostly commercial) software packages, because it is not being developed as a program with a specific purpose, but rather as a collection of tools and scripts which we needed at some point in our research projects. Many of the tasks for which we now use \pyformex could be done also with some other software package, like a CAD program %(e.g. SolidWorks\textregistered)
or a %(MatLab\textregistered{} style)
matrix calculation package or a solid modeler/renderer %genre Blender
or a finite element pre- and postprocessor%(such as GiD)
. Each of these is very well suited for the task it was designed for, but none provides all the features of \pyformex in a single consistent environment, and certainly not as free software. 


Perhaps the most important feature of \pyformex is that it was primarily intended to be an easy scripting language for creating geometrical models of 3D-structures. The Graphical User Interface was only added as a convenient means to visualize the designed structure. \pyformex can still run without user interface, and this makes it ideal for use in a batch toolchain. Anybody involved in the simulation of the mechanical behaviour of materials and structures will testify that most of the work (often 80-90\%) goes into the building of the model, not into the simulations itself. Repeatedly building a model for optimization of your structure then quickly becomes cumbersome, unless you use a tool like \pyf, allowing for automated and unattended building of model variants. 


The author of \pyformex, professor in structural engineering and heavy computer user since mainframe times, deeply regrets that computing skills of nowadays engineering students are often limited to using graphical interfaces of mostly commercial packages. This greatly limits their skills, because in their way of thinking: 'If there is no menu item to do some task, then it can not be done!'
The hope to get some of them back into coding has been a stimulus in continuing our work on \pyformex. The strength of the \pyformex scripting language and the elegance of Python have already attracted many on this path.
 
Finally, \pyformex is, and will always be, free software in both meanings of free: guaranteeing your freedom (see \ref{sec:license}) and without charging a fee for it.

\section{Installation}
\label{sec:installation}
\subsection{Prerequisites}
\label{sec:prerequisites}
In order to run \pyformex, you need to have the following installed (and working) on your computer.
\begin{itemize}
\item \htmladdnormallinkfoot{Python}{\pythonURL}: Version 2.4 or higher is recommended. Versions 2.3 and 2.2 might work with only a few minor changes.
Nearly all Linux distributions come with Python installed, so this should not be no major obstacle.
\item \htmladdnormallinkfoot{NumPy}{\numpyURL}: Version 1.0-rc1 or higher. Earlier versions can be made to work, but will require some changes to be made. NumPy is the package used for fast numerical array operations in Python and is essential for \pyformex.\footnote{The \texttt{Numarray} package, which was used up until \pyformex 0.3, is no longer supported }
On Linux systems, installing NumPy from source is usually straightforward. Debian users can install the package python-numpy.The extra packages python-numpy-ext and python-scipy give saom added functionality, but are not required for the basic operation of \pyf. For Windows, binary packages are available on the \htmladdnormallinkfoot{Sourceforge download page}{http://www.numpy.org/}.
\end{itemize}
If you only want to use the Formex data model and transformation methods, the above will suffice. But most probably you will also want to run the \pyformex Graphical User Interface (GUI) for visualizing your structures. Then you also need the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item \htmladdnormallinkfoot{Qt4}{http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt}: The widget toolkit on which the GUI was built. For Debian users this  comes in the packages python-qt4.
\item \htmladdnormallinkfoot{PyQt4}{http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/index.php}: The Python bindings for Qt4. Debian users should install the packages python-qt4 and python-qt4-gl.
\item \htmladdnormallinkfoot{PyOpenGL}{http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/}: Python bindings for OpenGL, used for drawing and manipulating the 3D-structures. For debian users this is in the package python-opengl.
\end{itemize}

Since version 0.7, \pyf includes an acceleration library that can increase the speed of some low level operations (e.g. drawing), especially when working on very large structures. If you want to compile and use this library, you also need to have a working C compiler and the Python and OpenGL header files. On a Debian based system, you should install tha packages python-dev, python-qt4-dev and libgl1-mesa-dev.

\subsection{Downloading}
\label{sec:downloading}
The official releases of \pyformex can be downloaded from the 
\htmladdnormallinkfoot{\pyformex website}{\websiteURL}. As of the writing of this manual, the latest release is \htmladdnormallinkfoot{\pyfversion}{\latestpyf}. 
\pyformex is currently distributed in the form of a \Code{.tar.gz} (tarball) archive. See \ref{sec:installation-linux} for how to proceed further.

Alternatively you can download the tarball releases from our \htmladdnormallinkfoot{local FTP server}{\bumpsFTPserver}. The server may be slower, but occasionally you can find there an interim release or release candidate not (yet) available on the official server.

Finally, you can also get the latest development code from the SVN repository on the \htmladdnormallinkfoot{\pyformex website}{\websiteURL}. If you have \htmladdnormallinkfoot{Subversion}{http://subversion.tigris.org/} installed on your system, you can just do\CodeLine{svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/pyformex/trunk pyformex}
and the whole current \pyformex tree will be copied to a subdirectory \code{pyformex} on your current path.

\emph{Unless you want to help with the development or you absolutely need some of the latest features or bugfixes, the tarball releases are what you want to go for. 
}


\subsection{Installation on Linux platforms}
\label{sec:installation-linux}
Once you have downloaded the \pyformex tarball, unpack it with
\CodeLine{tar xvzf pyformex-version.tar.gz}
Then go to the created pyformex directory:
\CodeLine{cd pyformex-version}
and do (with root privileges) 
\CodeLine{python setup.py install --prefix=/usr/local}
This will install \pyformex under \Code{/usr/local/}. You can change the prefix to install in some other place.

The installation procedure installs everything into a single directory, and creates a symlink to the executable in \Code{/usr/local/bin}.
You can use the command \Code{pyformex --whereami} to find out where \pyformex is installed. 

Finally, a \pyformex installation can usually be removed by giving the command \Code{pyformex --remove} and answering 'yes' to the question. You may want to do this before installing a new version, especially if you install a new release of an already existing version.


\subsection{Installation on Windows platforms}
\label{sec:installation-windows}
There is no installation procedure yet. All the pre-requisite packages are available for Windows, so in theory it is possible to run \pyformex on Windows. We know of some users who are running \pyformex succesfully using the \Code{{-}{-}nogui} option, i.e. without the Graphical User Interface (GUI).  
A few things may need to be changed for running the GUI on Windows. We might eventually have a look at this in the future, but it certainly is not our primary concern.
Still, any feedback on (successful or not successful) installation attempts on Windows is welcome.


\section{Running \pyf}
\label{sec:running}
To run \pyf, simply enter the command \Code{pyformex} in a terminal window. This will start the \pyf Graphical User Interface (GUI), from where you can launch examples or load, edit and run your own \pyf scripts. 

The installation procedure may have installed \pyf into your desktop menu or even have created a start button in the desktop panel. These provide convenient shortcuts to start the \pyf GUI by the click of a mouse button.

The \pyf program takes some optional command line arguments, that modify the behaviour of the program. Appendix~\ref{cha:commandline} gives a full list of all options. For normal use however you will seldom need to use any of them.
Therefore, we will only explain here the more commonly used ones.

By default, \pyf sends diagnostical and informational messages to the terminal from which the program was started. Sometimes this may be inconvenient, e.g. because the user has no access to the starting terminal. You can redirect these messages to the message window of the \pyf GUI by starting pyformex with the command\Code{pyformex --redirect}. The desktop starters installed by the \pyf installation procedure use this option.

In some cases the user may want to use the mathematical power of \pyf without the GUI. This is e.g. useful to run complex automated procedures from a script file. For convenience, \pyf will automatically enter this batch mode (without GUI) if the name of a script file was specified on the command line; when a script file name is absent, \pyf start in GUI mode. Even when specifying a script file, You can still force the GUI mode by adding the option \Code{--gui} to the command line.


\section{Getting started with the \pyformex GUI}
\label{sec:gui-tutorial}
While the \pyf GUI has become much more elaborate in recent versions, its intention will never be to provide a fully interactive environment to operate on geometrical data. The first purpose of \pyf will always remain to provide an framework for easily creating scripts to operate on geometries. Automization of otherwise tedious tasks is our main focus.

The GUI mainly serves the following purposes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Display a structure in 3D. This includes changing the viewpoint, orientation and viewing distance. Thus you can interactively rotate, translate, zoom.
\item Save a view in one of the supported image formats. Most of the images in this manual and on the \pyformex{} website were created that way. 
\item Changing \pyformex settings (though not everything can be changed through the GUI yet).
\item Running \pyformex scripts, possibly starting other programs and display their results.
\item Interactively construct, select, change, import or export geometrical structures. 
\end{itemize}

Unlike with most other geometrical modelers, in \pyf you usually design a geometrical model by writing a small script with the mathematical expressions needed to generate it. Any text editor will be suitable for this purpose. The main author of \pyf uses \htmladdnormallinkfoot{GNU Emacs}{\gnuEmacs}, but this is just a personal preference. Any modern text editor will be fine, and the one you are accustomed with, will probably be the best choice.
Since \htmladdnormallinkfoot{Python}{\pythonURL} is the language used in \pyformex scripts, a Python aware editor is highly preferable. It will highlight the syntax and help you with proper alignment (which is very important in Python).
The default editors of KDE and Gnome and most other modern editors will certainly do well. 
 A special purpose editor integrated into the \pyf GUI is on our TODO list, but it certainly is not our top priority, because general purpose editors are already adequate for our purposes. 

Learning how to use \pyformex is best done by studying and changing some of the examples. We suggest that you first take a look at the examples included in the \pyformex GUI and select those that display geometrical structures and/or use features that look interesting to you. Then you can study the source code of those examples and see how the structures got built and how the features were obtained.
Depending on your installation and configuration, the examples can be found under the \menuselection{Examples} or \menuselection{Scripts} main menu item.
The examples may appear classified according to themes or keywords, which can help you in selecting appropriate examples.

Selecting an example from the menu will normally execute the script, possibly ask for some interactive input and display the resulting geometrical structure.
To see the source of the script, choose the \menuselection{File \sub Edit Script} menu item.

Before starting to write your own scripts, you should probably get acquainted with the basic data structures and instructions of Python, NumPy and \pyf.


\section{Quick {Python tutorial}}
\label{sec:python-tutorial}
\pyf is written in the Python language, and Python is also the scripting language of \pyf. Since the intent of \pyf is to design structures by using scripts, you will at least need to have some basic knowledge of Python before you can use \pyf for your own projects.

There is ample documentation about Python freely available on the \htmladdnormallinkfoot{web}{\pythonURL}. 
If you are new to Python, but have already some programming experience, the \htmladdnormallinkfoot{Python tutorial}{\pythonTUT} may be a good starting point.
Or else, you can take a look at one of the \htmladdnormallinkfoot{beginners' guides}{\pythonBEG}. 

Do not be be afraid of having to learn a new programming language: Python is known as own of the easiest languages to get started with: just a few basic concepts suffice to produce quite powerful scripts. Most developers and users of \pyf have started without any knowledge of Python.

\Todo{To do: Introduce the (for \pyf users) most important Python concepts.}


\section{Quick NumPy tutorial}
\label{sec:numpy-tutorial}
Numerical Python (or NumPy for short) is an extension to the Python language providing efficient operations on large (numerical) arrays. \pyf relies heavily on NumPy, and most likely you will need to use some NumPy functions in your scripts. As NumPy is still quite young, the available documentation is not so extensive yet. Still, the \htmladdnormallinkfoot{tentative NumPy tutorial}{http://www.scipy.org/Tentative_NumPy_Tutorial} already provides the basics.

If you have ever used some other matrix language, you will find a lot of similar concepts in NumPy.


\Todo{To do: Introduce the (for \pyf users) most important NumPy concepts.}


\section{How to proceed from here}
By now, you should have enough basic knowledge about Python and NumPy to continue by studying the \pyf tutorial in chapter~\ref{cha:tutorial}.
