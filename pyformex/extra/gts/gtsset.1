gtsset [OPTION] OPERATION FILE1 FILE2
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Compute set operations between surfaces, where OPERATION is either.
union, inter, diff, all.
.sp
FILE1 and FILE2 are files with closed surface representations in GTS format.
.sp
The default operation is to write a new closed surface in GTS format to stdout.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-inter,  \-i
.
Output an OOGL (Geomview) representation of the curve
intersection of the surfaces
.TP
.B \-\-self,  \-s
.
Check that the surfaces are not self\-intersecting.
If one of them is, the set of self\-intersecting faces
is written (as a GtsSurface) on standard output.
.TP
.B \-\-verbose,  \-v
.
Do not print statistics about the surface.
.TP
.B \-\-help,  \-h
