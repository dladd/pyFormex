Installation procedure for GTS utilities
========================================

The 'TriSurface' objects in pyFormex can make use of some powerful features
of the GTS (GNU Triangulated Surfaces) library. To interface with this library
you need to compile and install the programs in this directory.

You need to have the GTS and glib libraries installed, including the 
development files. Pacakges are available for many Linux distributions.
On Debian and like systems (Ubuntu) you just need to install 
 - libgts-dev
 - libglib-2.0-dev

Then compile and install the programs with:
  make
  make install

The default install is under '/usr/local/' and requires root privileges.

Afterwards, you can clean up with:
  make clean

Or do it all at once with 
  make all
