"""Script Template

This is a template file to show the general layout of a pyFormex script.
In the current version, a pyFormex script should obey the following rules:

- file name extension is '.py'
- first (comment) line contains 'pyformex'

The script starts by preference with a docstring (like this),
composed of a short first line, then a blank line and
one or more lines explaining the intention of the script.
