"""Script Template

This is a template file to show the general layout of a pyFormex script.
In the current version, a pyFormex script should obey the following rules:
- file name extension is '.py'
- first (comment) line contains 'pyformex'
The script starts by preference with a docstring (like this), composed of a
short first line, a blank line and one or more lines explaining the intention
of the script.
