Installation procedure for GTS library and utilities
====================================================

The 'TriSurface' objects in pyFormex can make use of some powerful fetatures
of the GTS (GNU Triangulated Surfaces) library.
While the Linux distribution of your choice may provide a package for this
library, in most cases it will not install the binaries required for pyFormex.

The gts.install procedure in this directory will download, compile and install
the GTS library and all that is needed to let it cooperate with pyFormex.
At the same time it will fix some bugs.

By default the installation is done under /usr/local and you will need root
privileges to do so. Also, you will need to have the glib2 header files (on
Debian and alikes: install package libglib2.0-dev.

The full installation can be done with a single command (as root):
./gts.install all
