.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This manual page documents briefly the pyformex command.
.sp
pyFormex is a program for generating, transforming and manipulating large geometrical models of 3D structures by sequences of mathematical operations. Thanks to a powerful (Python based) scripting language, pyFormex is very well suited for the automated design of spatial frame structures. It provides a wide range of operations on surface meshes, like STL type triangulated surfaces. There are provisions to import medical scan images. pyFormex can also be used as a pre\- and post\-processor for Finite Element analysis programs. Finally, it might be used just for creating some nice graphics.
.sp
Using pyFormex, the topology of the elements and the final geometrical form can be decoupled. Often, topology is created first and then mapped onto the geometry. Through the scripting language, the user can define any sequence of transformations, built from provided or user defined functions. This way, building parametric models becomes a natural thing.
.sp
While pyFormex is still under development, it already provides a fairly stable scripting language and an OpenGL GUI environment for displaying and manipulating the generated structures.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
The pyformex command follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (\(aq\-\(aq). The non\-option arguments are filenames
of existing pyFormex scripts, possibly followed by arguments, that will be
executed by the pyFormex engine. If a script file uses arguments, it is
responsible for removing the arguments from the list.
.sp
A summary of the most important options is included below.
A complete overview is can be found
from the \(aqpyformex \-h\(aq command. For a complete description of the use and
operation of pyFormex, see the online documentation at
\fI\%http://pyformex.org/doc\fP or the documentation included with the distribution.
