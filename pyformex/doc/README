#
# pyFormex is a program for generating, manipulating and operating on
# large geometrical models of 3D structures by subsequent mathematical
# transformations.
# It aims primarily at spatial frame structures, but can handle surface and
# volume models as well.
# Through its powerful scripting language, it is especially useful
# for automated and parametric design.
#
# If you find it useful for something else, please go ahead.
# Feel free to contact the author if you have any questions or remarks.
# 
# More information on the website: http://pyformex.berlios.de

#
# BEWARE: this is alpha software undergoing frequent changes!
# AND: pyFormex comes with absolutely no Warranty 
#

Prerequisites:
-------------- 
For scripting and mathematical transformations (without GUI):

python: http://www.python.org  
	(version 2.4 or higher; 2.3 can work with some minor changes)
numpy: /http://numpy.scipy.org/
	(version 1.0-rc1 or higher.)

For the GUI:

Qt4: http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt
PyQt4: http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/index.php
PyOpenGL: http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/


Install prerequisites on Debian GNU/Linux
-----------------------------------------
On Debian (lenny) systems you can install all prerequisites and their 
dependencies with the command:
  apt-get install python-qt4-gl python-numpy

The optimization scripts need scipy:
  apt-get install python-scipy

If you want to compile the acceleration library (strongly recommended):
  apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev


Howto install pyFormex:
----------------------
If a previous version of pyFormex was already installed on your system,
you may want to remove the older version first before installing the new one.
See further (Howto uninstall pyFormex)

We suppose you have installed all the prerequisites and downloaded the
pyformex source tarball: pyformex-VERSION.tar.gz

Unpack the pyFormex source tarball:
   tar xvzf pyformex-VERSION.tar.gz
Go to the created pyformex directory:
   cd pyformex-VERSION
Do (with root privileges)
   python setup.py install prefix=/usr/local
This will install pyFormex under /usr/local/. You can change the prefix
to install in some other place.

The installation procedure installs everything into a single directory,
and creates a symlink to the executable in /usr/local/bin.
You can use the command pyformex --whereami to find out where pyFormex
is installed.

If you have xdg-utils on your system, the installation procedure will also
install a menu and desktop starter for pyFormex.


Howto uninstall pyFormex:
----------------------
A pyFormex installation of version 0.5 or later can be removed with the command
  pyformex --remove
and then answering 'yes' to the question.


 
Howto install the gl2ps option:
-------------------------------
gl2ps provides image output in PostScript (EPS) format.
The easiest way to make gl2ps available from inside pyFormex is to
install python-gl2ps: it includes the gl2ps library and the Python bindings.

- Make sure you have the libc and (mesa) GL header files installed. (On Debian,
  you can e.g. apt-get install libc6-dev libgl1-mesa-dev)
- Download the file python-gl2ps-1.1.2.tar.gz
- Unpack the archive
- Go into the created directory python-gl2ps-1.1.2 and execute (as root):
    python setup.py install
- If all goes well, you have gl2ps installed.



Documentation:
--------------

The manual is included with the pyFormex distribution. Execute the command
pyformex --whereami to find out where the pyformex files are installed.
When working with the pyFormex gui, you can load the manual in your browser
through the help menu, or view the online manual at
http://pyformex.berlios.de/manual    

The rest of this documentation has become superfluous and will probably be
removed in a next release. 

Because it is not obvious from the GUI:

The canvas showing the Formex has dynamic zoom/pan/rotate functionality.
Moving the mouse with one of the buttons depressed will activate this:
  LEFT mouse button : rotate :
	* moving radially w.r.t the center of the screen rotates around an
	axis in the screen, perpendicular to the direction of the movement
	* moving tangentially rotates around the axis perpendicular to the 
	screen (the screen z-axis), but only it the click was not to close
	to the center of the screen. Just try it out and you will see what
	I mean 
  MIDDLE mouse button : pan
  RIGHT mouse button : zoom : horizontal movement zooms by camera lens angle,
        vertical movement zooms by changing camera distance. The first mode 
	keeps the perspective, the second one changes it.
	Moving right and up zooms in, left and down zooms out. Moving 
	diagonally from upper left to lower right more or less keeps the
	image size, while changing the perspective.

To use pyFormex, you create a script that builds a structure layout and 
geometry. Look at the examples to get the feeling of how it is working. 
Use the File->Play menu selection to display the structure. 

The examples and the python source are relatively well documented.
