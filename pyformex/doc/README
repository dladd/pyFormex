What is pyFormex?
=================
pyFormex is a tool for generating, manipulating and transforming large
geometrical models of 3D structures by sequences of mathematical 
transformations. Thanks to a powerful (Python based) scripting language,
pyFormex is very well suited for the automated design of spatial frame
structures. It provides a wide range of operations on surface meshes, 
like STL type triangulated surfaces. There are provisions to import medical 
scan images. pyFormex can also be used as a pre- and post-processor for 
Finite Element analysis programs. Finally, it might be used just for 
creating some nice graphics.

Using pyFormex, the topology of the elements and the final geometrical form
can be decoupled. Often, topology is created first and then mapped onto the
geometry. Through the scripting language, the user can define any sequence
of transformations, built from provided or user defined functions. 
This way, building parametric models becomes a natural thing.

While pyFormex is still under development (http://pyformex.berlios.de), 
it already provides a fairly stable scripting language and an OpenGL GUI
environment for displaying and manipulating the generated structures. 


Installation
============

Prerequisites
------------- 
For scripting and mathematical transformations (without GUI):

python: http://www.python.org  
	(version 2.4 or higher; 2.3 can work with some minor changes)
numpy: /http://numpy.scipy.org/
	(version 1.0-rc1 or higher.)

For the GUI:

Qt4: http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt
PyQt4: http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/index.php
PyOpenGL: http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/


Easy way to install prerequisites on Debian GNU/Linux
-----------------------------------------------------
On Debian (lenny) systems you can install all prerequisites and their 
dependencies with the command:
  apt-get install python-qt4-gl python-numpy

The optimization scripts need scipy:
  apt-get install python-scipy

If you want to compile the acceleration library (which is recommended):
  apt-get install gcc python-dev libgl1-mesa-dev


Howto install pyFormex:
-----------------------
If a previous version of pyFormex was already installed on your system,
you may want to remove the older version first before installing the new one.
See further (Howto uninstall pyFormex)

We suppose you have installed all the prerequisites and downloaded the
pyformex source tarball: pyformex-VERSION.tar.gz

Unpack the pyFormex source tarball:
   tar xvzf pyformex-VERSION.tar.gz
Go to the created pyformex directory:
   cd pyformex-VERSION
Do (with root privileges)
   python setup.py install --prefix=/usr/local
This will install pyFormex under /usr/local/. You can change the prefix
to install in some other place.

After installation you can remove the directory where you unpacked the tarball.

The installation procedure installs everything into a single directory,
and creates a symlink to the executable in /usr/local/bin.
You can use the command pyformex --whereami to find out where pyFormex
is installed.

If you have xdg-utils on your system, the installation procedure will also
install a menu and desktop starter for pyFormex.


Howto uninstall pyFormex:
-------------------------
A pyFormex installation of version 0.5 or later can be removed with the command
  pyformex --remove
and then answering 'yes' to the question.


 
Howto install the gl2ps option:
-------------------------------
gl2ps provides image output in PostScript (EPS) format.
The easiest way to make gl2ps available from inside pyFormex is to
install python-gl2ps: it includes the gl2ps library and the Python bindings.

- Make sure you have the libc and (mesa) GL header files installed. (On Debian,
  you can e.g. apt-get install libc6-dev libgl1-mesa-dev)
- Download the file python-gl2ps-1.1.2.tar.gz
- Unpack the archive
- Go into the created directory python-gl2ps-1.1.2 and execute (as root):
    python setup.py install
- If all goes well, you have gl2ps installed.



Documentation
=============

The manual is included with the pyFormex distribution. Execute the command
pyformex --whereami to find out where the pyformex files are installed.
When working with the pyFormex gui, you can load the manual in your browser
through the help menu, or view the online manual at
http://pyformex.berlios.de/manual    

To use pyFormex, you create a script that builds a structure layout and 
geometry. Look at the examples to get the feeling of how it is working. 
Use the File->Play menu selection to display the structure. 

The examples and the python source are relatively well documented.
