pyFormex 0.7.3  Releasenotes
============================

This is a collection of the most prominent changes in pyFormex 0.7.3
compared to the previous release 0.7.2


Installation
------------
pyFormex should now use whatever is the default Python interpreter for the user running the pyformex command. This facilitates non-standard installations (e.g. in user space).
Of course, packagers for distributions may still replace the current script executer (/usr/bin/env python) by any particular Python version. We recommend Python 2.5 or higher. 


Command line
------------

- When running pyformex with the --gui option, remaining command line parameters are now intrepreted just as with the --nogui option: i.e. as pyformex scripts to be executed (and possibly their parameters).


Configuration
-------------
- The default startup script is now '~/.pyformex.startup'


Core
----

- CascadingDict has been renamed to CDict
- connectivity module has been moved from plugins into the core, as more and more modules get dependent on the Connectivity class. (surface, centerline, fe, mesh)
- mydict.py: made ReturnNone and RaiseError functions in place of static methods
- odict.py: 
  + added listSymDifference, listSelect and listConcatenate functions
  + ODict: implemented update(), values() and items() methods

Gui
---

- widgets.py: 
  + added unchangeable info field to input items.
  + contents of input widgets can be changed by script 
  + input dialogs have customizable buttons
  + added some Table widgets

- startup scripts and script directories can be configured from the GUI perference settings menu.

Drawing
-------
- Accelerated picking function available from the pyFormex compiled library.
- An important change in the 'bbox' and 'view' parameters of the draw() function: they now have None as default value, which is then set from the canvas drawing options, to be set with 'setDrawingOptions'.

- When rendering TriSurfaces with lighting, there is an option to use
  averaged normals at the vertices of the triangles, providing a much smoother
  look of the surface. An optional toolbar button toggles between triangle
  based and averaged normals.

- In view of future changes, the drawing lock mechanism was moved to a separate module: drawlock.


Scripting
---------
- playing scripts under the GUI was moved from module 'gui.draw' to 'script' 
- askFilename: the 'cur' and 'file' parameters were merged


Plugins
-------
- surface, surface_menu:
  + TriSurface: new methods: borderEdgeNrs, borderNodeNrs, smoothLowPass, smoothLaplaceHC 

- curve: A new plugin for handling continuous curves in 3D space. Currently implemented are PolyLine, Bezier, CardinalSPline and NaturalSpline. Full NURBS curve support is scheduled for release 0.8

- isopar: added 'hex36' isoparametric transformation

- properties: got more facilities (e.g. amplitude)

- fe_abq: output of amplitude

- postproc, fe_post, postproc_menu: some enhancements, but this is still work in progress 

- tetgen: added a function ReadFaces to read a Tetgen .faces file

Examples
--------

- Analysis examples have been moved into the global example directory and are
  classified by the keywords.
- Curves: illustrates the use of the new curve plugin.

License
