pyFormex 0.8.4  Releasenotes
============================

This is a collection of the most prominent changes in pyFormex 0.8.4
compared to the previous release 0.8.3. Like always, besides the new
things mentioned below, we also have lots of bug fixes, code cleanup
and functionality enhancements.



Documentation
-------------
- More modules are now included in the autogenerated reference
  manual. More functions descriptions include example of usage.


Installation
------------


Command line
------------
- ``pyformex --whereami PYFORMEX_MODULE``: runs the doctests inside the
specified pyformex module, and reports if a test fails. This is mainly
intended for developers.
- The ``--safelib`` and ``--unsafelib`` options have been removed.


Configuration
-------------


Core
----
- arraytools: some vector functions moved here from coords/formex
  modules; new functions: histogram2, movingView, movingAverage, raqndomNoise
- connectivity: a Connectivity object can now store its element type;
  some Mesh methods moved to Connectivity
- coords: new Coords methods: addNoise, replicate, match; moved
  sweepCoords function from mesh module
- elements: completely revised and extended element database; moved
  mesh data from mesh module
- geomfile: NurbsCurve and NurbsSurface can now be stored to/read from
  a pyFormex geometry file
- utils: new functions selectDict, removeDict


Mesh
----
- new Mesh methods: getFreeEntitiesMesh, getFreeEdgesMesh, reverse,
  reflect, matchCoords, matchCentroids, and a whole bunch of methods
  moved up from TriSurface


Gui
---
- canvas viewports can have different sizes 
- images of the canvas can be saved with a specified resolution
  without resizing the canvas


Widgets
-------
- InputItem is now a widget instead of a layout
- new InputItem: InputList
Some cleanup in the set of widgets will continue through the next
release. 


Drawing
-------
- most quadratic elements can now be drawn as quadratic
  lines/surfaces. This is to be configured by the user in the Settings dialog.
- direct drawing of NubsCurve and NurbsSurface objects
- ColorLegend allows specification of the number of labels
- most ``draw`` functions now have an option ``nolight=True`` to draw
  without lighting in modes with lights enabled, and an option
  ``ontop=True`` to make the object fully visible (even if it is hidden
  behind some opaque object). These options are mostly use to draw
  decorations and annotations.
- ``drawImage``: directly draws a raster image to the OpenGL canvas.


Scripting
---------


Projects
--------


Plugins
-------
- geometry_menu (NEW): a new menu to work on all kind of geometry objects
  using a common interface. It will replace the formex_menu and
  mesh_menu.
- nurbs_menu (NEW): a menu to work experiment with NURBS curves and surfaces
- fe_ast (NEW): a plugin to interface with code_aster
- calpy_itf: added the QuadInterpolator class


External
--------
- calix can be called and postprocessed, see FeEx example
- gambit-neu scripts in pyformex/bin


Examples
--------
New examples:
- SplineSurface
.. - RotoTranslation
.. - SurfaceProjection
.. - BezierSpline
.. - Carpetry

- FeEx: 
  - direct run and postprocessing of calix jobs 
  - 

.. End
