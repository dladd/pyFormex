pyFormex 0.7.1  Releasenotes 
============================

This is a collection of the most prominent changes in pyFormex 0.7.1
compared to the previous release 0.7.

INSTALLATION
============


COMMAND LINE
============
The --dri/--nodri options are renamed to --force-dri and --force-nodri to hint that the user forces abnormal behavior when using them.

pyformex --detect shows the list of detected software without having to start the GUI. Convenient when reporting bugs.

GUI:
====
LOTS, LOTS, LOTS of new functions.

Some goodies: 
  - interactive picking
  - rendering of values on domains
  - lighting / smooth rendering is now fixed
  

CORE:
=====
Acceleration library
--------------------
Most drawing functions and all picking functions are now accelerated.



PLUGINS:
========
Properties 
----------
The property plugin has undergone major changes. The work on the plugin is not
finished yet, but the PropertyDB class has become consistent, powerful and fairly stable. Users can already safely build applications on it. Most prominent features are:
 - a single database class collecting all property data,
 - specified and named sets to attribute properties to specific elements of a geometrical object.

The fe_abq interface has been adapted to use the new property system.
   
Postproc
--------
The postproc plugin is developing into a powerful postprocessing engine.
Already some nice examples.
 

MANUAL:
=======
Added desription of the Property plugin.
