pyFormex 0.8.1  Releasenotes
============================

This is a collection of the most prominent changes in pyFormex 0.8
compared to the previous release 0.8


Documentation
-------------
The most notable change is the new documentation system, Sphinx, used
to create and manage the documentation. The old manual has been
removed from the distribution and the svn repositories, in favor of
the new docs. There will be a global cleanup and expansion of the docs
before the next release.
 

Installation

The installation procedure will install the new (sphinx) docs in the
pyFormex install tree.

Core
----
- Coords: new transformations 'hyperCylindrical' and 'flare'
- class method 'fromstring' to read 'Coords' or 'Formex' from a string


Gui

Drawing
-------
- All geometry Actors now support picking of actors, elements, edges, points 
- The Canvas can have a background with a vertical color gradient.
- The current viewport is visualized by a colored frame
- The ColorScale has two new color palets, which provide much better
  coloring: RAINBOW and IRAINBOW. Thanks to Tomas Praet for signaling
  this. RAINBOW is now the default.
- Drawing 2D text has been reverted to the GLUT text fonts. Better
  font selection and alignment using gravity have been aded.
