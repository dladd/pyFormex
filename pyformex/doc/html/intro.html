<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title first">Abstract</p>
<p>This part explains shortly what pyFormex is and what it is not.
It sets the conditions under which you are allowed to use, modify and
distribute the program.
Next is a list of prerequisite software parts that you need to have
installed in order to be able to run this program.
We explain how to download and install pyFormex.
Finally, you&#8217;ll find out what basic knowledge you should have in order
to understand the tutorial and succesfully use pyFormex.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-pyformex">
<span id="sec-what-is-pyformex"></span><h2>What is pyFormex?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-pyformex" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You probably expect to find here a short definition of what pyFormex is and
what it can do for you. I may have to disappoint you: describing the essence
of pyFormex in a few lines is not easy to do, because the program can
be (and is being) used for very different tasks.
So I will give you two answers here: a short one and a long one.</p>
<p>The short answer is that pyFormex is a program to
<em>generate large structured sets of coordinates by means of subsequent
mathematical transformations gathered in a script.</em>
If you find this definition too dull, incomprehensible or just not
descriptive enough, read on through this section and look at some of the
examples in this documentation and on the <a class="reference external" href="http://pyformex.org">pyFormex website</a>.
You will then probably have a better idea of what pyFormex is.</p>
<p>The initial intent of pyFormex was the rapid design of three-dimensional
structures with a geometry that can easier be obtained through mathematical
description than through interactive generation of its subparts and
assemblage thereof. Although the initial development of the program
concentrated mostly on wireframe type structures, surface and solid elements
have been part of pyFormex right from the beginning.
There is already an extensive plugin for working with triangulated surfaces,
and pyFormex is increasingly being used to generate solid meshes of
structures.
Still, many of the examples included with the pyFormex distribution are of
wireframe type, and so are most of the examples in the <a class="reference internal" href="tutorial.html"><em>pyFormex tutorial</em></a>.</p>
<p>A good illustration of what pyFormex can do and what it was intended for is
the stent <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id2">[1]</a> structure in the figure <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-wirestent-example"><em>WireStent example</em></a>.
It is one of the many examples provided with pyFormex.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="fig-wirestent-example">
<img alt="A wire stent" src="_images/wirestent.png" />
<p class="caption">WireStent example</p>
</div>
<p>The structure is composed of 22032 line segments, each defined by 2 points.
Nobody in his right mind would ever even try to input all the 132192 coordinates
of all the points describing that structure.
With pyFormex, one could define the structure by the following sequence of
operations, illustrated in the figure <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-wirestent-steps"><em>First three steps in building the WireStent example</em></a>:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Create a nearly planar base module of two crossing wires. The wires have a
slight out-of-plane bend, to enable the crossing.</li>
<li>Extend the base module with a mirrored and translated copy.</li>
<li>Replicate the base module in both directions to create a (nearly
planar) rectangular grid.</li>
<li>Roll the planar grid into a cylinder.</li>
</ol>
<p>pyFormex provides all the operations needed to define the geometry in this
way.</p>
<div class="align-center figure align-center" id="fig-wirestent-steps">
<img alt="A wire stent" src="_images/wirestent-steps.png" />
<p class="caption">First three steps in building the WireStent example</p>
</div>
<p>pyFormex does not fit into a single category of traditional (mostly
commercial) software packages, because it is not being developed as a
program with a specific purpose, but rather as a collection of tools
and scripts which we needed at some point in our research projects.
Many of the tasks for which we now use pyFormex could be
done also with some other software package, like a CAD program or a matrix
calculation package or a solid modeler/renderer or a finite element pre- and
postprocessor. Each of these is probably very well suited for the task
it was designed for, but none provides all the features of pyFormex
in a single consistent environment, and certainly not as free software.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important feature of pyFormex is that it was
primarily intended to be an easy scripting language for creating
geometrical models of 3D-structures. The graphical user interface
(GUI) was only added as a convenient means to visualize the designed
structure.  pyFormex can still run without user interface, and this
makes it ideal for use in a batch toolchain. Anybody involved in the
simulation of the mechanical behavior of materials and structures
will testify that most of the work (often 80-90%) goes into the
building of the model, not into the simulations itself. Repeatedly
building a model for optimization of your structure quickly becomes
cumbersome, unless you use a tool like pyFormex, allowing for
automated and unattended building of model variants.</p>
<p>The author of  pyFormex, professor in structural engineering and heavy
computer user and programmer since mainframe times, deeply regrets that
computing skills
of nowadays engineering students are often limited to using graphical
interfaces of mostly commercial packages.
This greatly limits their skills, because in their way of thinking:
&#8216;If there is no menu item to do some task, then it can not be done!&#8217;
The hope to get some of them back into coding has been a stimulus in
continuing our work on pyFormex. The strength of the scripting language
and the elegance of Python have already attracted many users on this path.</p>
<p>Finally, pyFormex is, and always will be, free software in both meanings
of free: guaranteeing the freedom of the user (see <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-license"><em>License and Disclaimer</em></a>) and
without charging a fee for it. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id6" id="id3">[2]</a></p>

<p>Once you have installed and want to start using pyFormex, you will probably
be looking for help on how to do it.</p>
<p>If you are new to pyFormex, you should start with the <a class="reference internal" href="tutorial.html"><em>pyFormex tutorial</em></a>, which
will guide you step by step, using short examples, through the basic concepts
of Python, NumPy and pyFormex. You have to understand there is a lot to learn
at first, but afterwards the rewards will prove to be huge. You can skip the
sections on Python and NumPy if you already have some experience with it.</p>
<p>If you have used pyFormex before or you are of the adventurous type that does
not want to be told where to go and how to do it, skip the tutorial and go
directly to the <a class="reference internal" href="user-guide.html"><em>pyFormex user guide</em></a>. It provides the most thorough information
of all aspects of pyFormex.</p>

<h2>Getting Help<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-help" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you get stuck somewhere with using (or installing) pyFormex and you
need help, the best way is to go to the <a class="reference external" href="http://pyformex.org">pyFormex website</a> and ask for help
via the <a class="reference external" href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/support/?group=pyformex">Support tracker</a>. There&#8217;s a good change you will get helped quickly
there. Remember though that pyFormex is a free and open source software
project and its developers are not paid to develop or maintain pyFormex,
they just do this because they find pyFormex very helpful in their normal
daily activities.</p>
