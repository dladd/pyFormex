<span id="cha-gui"></span><h1>The Graphical User Interface<a class="headerlink" href="#the-graphical-user-interface" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>While the GUI has become much more elaborate in recent versions, its
intention will never be to provide a fully interactive environment to
operate on geometrical data. The main purpose of pyFormex will
always remain to provide a framework for easily creating scripts to
operate on geometries. Automization of otherwise tedious tasks is our
primary focus.</p>
<p>The GUI mainly serves the following purposes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Display a structure in 3D. This includes changing the viewpoint, orientation
and viewing distance. Thus you can interactively rotate, translate, zoom.</li>
<li>Save a view in one of the supported image formats. Most of the images in this
manual and on the  website were created that way.</li>
<li>Changing settings (though not everything can be changed through the GUI yet).</li>
<li>Running scripts, possibly starting other programs and display their results.</li>
<li>Interactively construct, select, change, import or export geometrical
structures.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike with most other geometrical modelers, in you usually design a geometrical
model by writing a small script with the mathematical expressions needed to
generate it. Any text editor will be suitable for this purpose. The main author
of uses GNU Emacs, but this is just a personal preference. Any modern text
editor will be fine, and the one you are accustomed with, will probably be the
best choice. Since Python is the language used in scripts, a Python aware editor
is highly preferable. It will highlight the syntax and help you with proper
alignment (which is very important in Python). The default editors of KDE and
Gnome and most other modern editors will certainly do well.  A special purpose
editor integrated into the GUI is on our TODO list, but it certainly is not our
top priority, because general purpose editors are already adequate for our
purposes.</p>
<p>Learning how to use is best done by studying and changing some of the examples.
We suggest that you first take a look at the examples included in the GUI and
select those that display geometrical structures and/or use features that look
interesting to you. Then you can study the source code of those examples and see
how the structures got built and how the features were obtained. Depending on
your installation and configuration, the examples can be found under the
<em class="menuselection">Examples</em> or <em class="menuselection">Scripts</em> main menu item. The
examples may appear classified according to themes or keywords, which can help
you in selecting appropriate examples.</p>
<p>Selecting an example from the menu will normally execute the script, possibly
ask for some interactive input and display the resulting geometrical structure.
To see the source of the script, choose the <em class="menuselection">File ‣ Edit
Script</em> menu item.</p>
<p>Before starting to write your own scripts, you should probably get acquainted
with the basic data structures and instructions of Python, NumPy and pyFormex.
You can do this by reading the <a class="reference internal" href="tutorial.html"><em>pyFormex tutorial</em></a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="starting-the-gui">
<h2>Starting the GUI<a class="headerlink" href="#starting-the-gui" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You start the pyFormex GUI by entering the command <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pyformex</span></tt> in a
terminal window. Depending on your installation, you may also have a
panel or menu button on your desktop from which you can start the
graphical interface by a simple mouse click.  When the main window
appears, it will look like the one shown in the figure
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-gui"><em>The pyFormex main window</em></a>. Your window manager will most likely have put some
decorations around it, but these are very much OS and window manager
dependent and are therefore not shown in the figure.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Finally, you can also start the GUI with the instruction</dt>
<dd><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">startGUI()</span></tt> from a pyFormex script executed in non-GUI mode.</dd>

<h2>Basic use of the GUI<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-use-of-the-gui" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As is still in its infancy, the GUI is subject to frequent changes and it would
make no sense to cover here every single aspect of it. Rather we will describe
the most important functions, so that users can quickly get used to working with
. Also we will present some of the more obscure features that users may not
expect but yet might be very useful.</p>
<p>The window (figure <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-gui"><em>The pyFormex main window</em></a>) comprises 5 parts. From top to bottom these
are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>the menu bar,</li>
<li>the tool bar,</li>
<li>the canvas (empty in the figure),</li>
<li>the message board, and</li>
<li>the status bar.</li>
</ol>
<p>Many of these parts look and work in a rather familiar way. The menu bar gives
access to most of the GUI features through a series of pull-down menus. The most
import functions are described in following sections.</p>
<p>The toolbar contains a series of buttons that trigger actions when clicked upon.
This provides an easier access to some frequently used functions, mainly for
changing the viewing parameters.</p>
<p>The canvas is a drawing board where your scripts can show the created
geometrical structures and provide them with full 3D view and manipulation
functions. This is obviously the most important part of the GUI, and even the
main reason for having a GUI at all. However, the contents of the canvas is
often mainly created by calling drawing functions from a script. This part of
the GUI is therefore treated in full detail in a separate chapter.</p>
<p>In the message board displays informative messages, requested results, possibly
also errors and any text that your script writes out.</p>
<p>The status bar shows the current status of the GUI. For now this only contains
the filename of the current script and an indicator if this file has been
recognized as a script (happy face) or not (unhappy face).</p>
<p>Between the canvas and the message board is a splitter allowing resizing the
parts of the window occupied by the canvas and message board. The mouse cursor
changes to a vertical resizing symbol when you move over it. Just click on the
splitter and move the mouse up or down to adjust the canvas/message board to
your likings.</p>
<p>The main window can be resized in the usual ways.</p>

<span id="sec-menu-settings"></span><h2>The <em class="menuselection">Settings</em> menu<a class="headerlink" href="#the-settings-menu" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Many aspects of the pyFormex GUI are configurable to suit better to
the user&#8217;s likings. This customization can be made persistent by
storing it in a configuration file. This is explained in
<a class="reference internal" href="config.html"><em>Configuring pyFormex</em></a>.</p>
<p>Many of the configuration variables however can be changed interactively from
the GUI itself.</p>
<ul class="simple" id="settings-commands">
<li><em class="menuselection">Settings ‣ Commands</em>: Lets you change the external
command name used for the editor, the HTML/text file viewer and the HTML
browser. Each of these values should be an executable command
accepting a file name as parameter.</li>

<span id="sec-mouse-interactions"></span><h2>Mouse interactions on the canvas<a class="headerlink" href="#mouse-interactions-on-the-canvas" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A number of actions can be performed by interacting with the mouse on the
canvas.  The default initial bindings of the mouse buttons are shown in the
following table.</p>
<div class="section" id="rotate-pan-and-zoom">
<h3>Rotate, pan and zoom<a class="headerlink" href="#rotate-pan-and-zoom" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You can use the mouse to dynamically rotate, pan and zoom the scene displayed on
the canvas. These actions are bound to the left, middle and right mouse buttons
by default. Pressing the corresponding mouse button starts the action; moving
the mouse with depressed button continuously performs the actions, until the
button is released. During picking operations, the mouse bindings are changed.
You can however still start the interactive rotate, pan and zoom, by holding
down the ALT key modifier when pressing the mouse button.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>rotate</dt>
<dd>Press the left mouse button, and while holding it down, move the mouse ove the
canvas: the scene will rotate. Rotating in 3D by a 2D translation of the mouse
is a fairly complex operation:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>Moving the mouse radially with respect to the center of the screen rotates</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">around an axis lying in the screen and perpendicular to the direction of the
movement.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>Moving tangentially rotates around an axis perpendicular to the screen (the</dt>
<dd><blockquote class="first">
<div><p>screen z-axis), but only if the mouse was not too close to the center of the
screen when the button was pressed.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p class="last">Try it out on some examples to get a feeling of the workinhg of mouse rotation.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>pan</dt>
<dd>Pressing the middle (or simultanuous left+right) mouse button and holding it
down, will move the scene in the direction of the mouse movement. Because this
is implemented as a movement of the camera in the opposite direction, the
perspective of the scene may change during this operation.</dd>
<dt>zoom</dt>
<dd>Interactive zooming is performed by pressing the right mouse button and move the
mouse while keeping the button depressed. The type of zoom action depends on the
direction of the movement:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">horizontal movement zooms by camera lens angle,</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">vertical movement zooms by changing camera distance.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The first mode keeps the perspective, the second changes it. Moving right and
upzooms in, left and down zooms out. Moving diagonally from upper left to lower
right more or less keeps the image size, while changing the perspective.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="interactive-selection">
<h3>Interactive selection<a class="headerlink" href="#interactive-selection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>During picking operations, the mouse button functionality is changed. Click and
drag the left mouse button to create a rectangular selection region on the
canvas. Depending on the modifier key that was used when pressing the button,
the selected items will be:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>NONE</dt>
<dd>set as the current selection;</dd>
<dt>SHIFT</dt>
<dd>added to the currentselection;</dd>
<dt>CTRL</dt>
<dd>removed from the current selection.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Clicking the right mouse button finishes the interactive selection mode.</p>
<p>During selection mode, using the mouse buttons in combination with the ALT
modifier key will still activate the default mouse functions (rotate/pan/zoom).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="customizing-the-gui">
<span id="sec-customize-gui"></span><h2>Customizing the GUI<a class="headerlink" href="#customizing-the-gui" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Some parts of the GUI can easily be customized by the user.  The appearance
(widget style and fonts) can be changed from the preferences menu. Custom menus
can be added by executing a script. Both are very simple tasks even for
beginning users. They are explained shortly hereafter.</p>
<p>Experienced users with a sufficient knowledge of Python and GUI building with Qt
can of course use all their skills to tune every single aspect of the GUI
according to their wishes. If you send us your modifications, we might even
include them in the official distribution.</p>
<div class="section" id="changing-the-appearance-of-the-gui">
<span id="sec-chang-appe-gui"></span><h3>Changing the appearance of the GUI<a class="headerlink" href="#changing-the-appearance-of-the-gui" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
</div>
<div class="section" id="adding-your-scripts-in-a-menu">
<span id="sec-adding-scripts-menu"></span><h3>Adding your scripts in a menu<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-your-scripts-in-a-menu" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>By default, pyFormex adds all the example scripts that come with the
distribution in a single menu accessible from the menubar. The scripts in this
menu are executed by selecting them from the menu. This is easier than opening
the file and then executing it.</p>
<p>You can customize this scripts menu and add your own scripts directories to it.
Just add a line like the following to the main section of your .pyformexrc
configuration file: &#8212;  scriptdirs = [(&#8216;Examples&#8217;, None), (&#8216;My Scripts&#8217;,
&#8216;/home/me/myscripts&#8217;), (&#8216;More&#8217;, &#8216;/home/me/morescripts&#8217;)]</p>
<p>Each tuple in this list consists of a string to be used as menu title and the
absolute path of a directory with your scripts. From each such directory all the
files that are recognized as scripts and do no start with a &#8216;.&#8217; or &#8216;_&#8217;, will be
included in the menu. If your scriptdirs setting has only one item, the menu
item will be created directly in the menubar. If there are multiple items, a top
menu named &#8216;Scripts&#8217; will be created with submenus for each entry.</p>
<p>Notice the special entry for the examples supplied with the distribution. You do
not specify the directory where the examples are: you would probably not even
know the correct path, and it could change when a new version of is installed.
As long as you keep its name to &#8216;Examples&#8217; (in any case: &#8216;examples&#8217; would work
as well) and the path set to None (unquoted!), will itself try to detect the
path to the installed examples.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="adding-custom-menus">
<span id="sec-adding-custom-menus"></span><h3>Adding custom menus<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-custom-menus" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When you start using for serious work, you will probably run into complex
scripts built from simpler subtasks that are not necessarily always executed in
the same order. While the scripting language offers enough functions to ask the
user which parts of the script should be executed, in some cases it might be
better to extend the GUI with custom menus to execute some parts of your script.</p>
<p>For this purpose, the gui.widgets module of provides a Menu widget class. Its
use is illustrated in the example Stl.py.</p>
