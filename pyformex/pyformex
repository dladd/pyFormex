"""pyFormex, a free program for creating and manipulating 3D geometry.

pyFormex is a powerful tool for generating, manipulating, transforming and
displaying large structural models of 3D geometry.
Based on a powerful scripting language, pyFormex is exceptionally suited for
generating parametric models and for the automization of tedious and recurring
tasks in the handling of geometrical models.
Built around a fully open architecture pyFormex allows the user to combine the
program with nearly any other software and to extend the program to suit his
own needs.

pyFormex is being developed at the IBiTech, Ghent University, and can be
distributed under the GNU General Public License, version 3 or later.
