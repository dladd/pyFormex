.. Description

SplineSurface
-------------
This example illustrates some advanced geometrical modeling tools using
spline curves and surfaces.

The script first creates a set of closed BezierSpline curves. Currently
two sets of curves are predefined:

- a set of transformations of a unit circle. The circle is scaled
  non-uniformously, resulting in an ellips, which is then rotated and
  translated.

- a set of curves obtained by cutting a triangulated surface model
  with a series of parallel planes. The original surface model was
  obtained from medical imaging processes and represents a human
  artery with a kink. These curves are read from a geometry file
  'splines.pgf' include in the pyFormex distribution. 

In the first case, the number of curves will be equal to the specified
number.  In the latter case, the number can not be larger than the
number of curves in the file.

The set of splines are then used to create a QuadSurface (a surface
consisting of quadrilaterals). The number of elements along the
splines can be chosen. The number of elements across the splines is
currently unused.
