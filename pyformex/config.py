"""A general yet simple configuration class.

| (C) 2005 Benedict Verhegghe
| Distributed under the GNU GPL version 3 or later

Why
   I wrote this simple class because I wanted to use Python
   expressions in my configuration files. This is so much more fun
   than using .INI style config files.  While there are some other
   Python config modules available on the web, I couldn't find one
   that suited my needs and my taste: either they are intended for
   more complex configuration needs than mine, or they do not work
   with the simple Python syntax I expected.

What
   Our Config class is just a normal Python dictionary which can hold
   anything.  Fields can be accessed either as dictionary lookup
   (config['foo']) or as object attributes (config.foo).  The class
   provides a function for reading the dictionary from a flat text
   (multiline string or file). I will always use the word 'file'
   hereafter, because that is what you usually will read the
   configuration from.  Your configuration file can have named
   sections. Sections are stored as other Python dicts inside the top
   Config dictionary. The current version is limited to one level of
   sectioning.

       key = value
       
    The resulting text is a legal Python script to define the items in the
    dict.
    """
    s = ""
    if isinstance(d,dict):
        for k,v in d.iteritems():
            if type(v) == str:
                s += '%s = "%s"\n' % (k,v)
            else:
                s += '%s = %s\n' % (k,v)
    return s


class Config(Dict):
    """A configuration class allowing Python expressions in the input.

    The configuration settings are stored in the __dict__ of a Python
    object.  An item 'foo' in the configuration 'config' can be accessed
    either as dictionary lookup (``config['foo']``) or as object attribute
    (``config.foo``).

    The configuration object can be initialized from a multiline string or
    a text file (or any other object that allows iterating over strings).
    
    The format of the config file/text is described hereafter.
   
    All config lines should have the format: key = value, where key is a
    string and value is a Python expression The first '=' character on the
    line is the delimiter between key and value.  Blanks around both the
    key and the value are stripped.  The value is then evaluated as a
    Python expression and stored in a variable with name specified by the
    key. This variable is available for use in subsequent configuration
    lines. It is an error to use a variable before it is defined.  The
    key,value pair is also stored in the config dictionary, unless the key
    starts with an underscore ('_'): this provides for local variables.

    Lines starting with '#' are comments and are ignored, as are empty
    and blank lines.  Lines ending with '\' are continued on the next
    line.  A line starting with '[' starts a new section. A section is
    nothing more than a Python dictionary inside the config
    dictionary. The section name is delimited by '['and ']'. All
    subsequent lines will be stored in the section dictionary instead
    of the toplevel dictionary.

    All other lines are executed as python statements. This allows
    e.g. for importing modules.

    Whole dictionaries can be inserted at once in the config with the
    update() function.
    
    All defined variables while reading config files remain available
    for use in the config file statements, even over multiple calls to
    the read() function. Variables inserted with addSection() will not
    be available as individual variables though, but can be access as
    ``self['name']``.
    
    As an example, if your config file looks like::
    
       aa = 'bb'
       bb = aa
       [cc]
       aa = 'aa'
       _n = 3
       rng = range(_n)
       
    the resulting configuration dictionary is
    ``{'aa': 'bb', 'bb': 'bb', 'cc': {'aa': 'aa', 'rng': [0, 1, 2]}}``

    As far as the resulting Config contents is concerned, the following are
    equivalent::
    
       C.update({'key':'value'})
       C.read("key='value'\\n")

    There is an important difference though: the second line will make a
    variable key (with value 'value') available in subsequent Config read()
    method calls.
