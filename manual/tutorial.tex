\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro-tut}

\pyformex is a Python implementation of Formex algebra. Using \pyformex, it is very easy to  generate large geometrical models of 3D structures by a sequence of mathematical transformations. It is especially suited for the automated design of spatial frame structures. But it can also be used for other tasks, like finite element preprocessing, or just for creating some nice pictures.

By writing a very simple script, a large geometry can be created by copying, translating, rotating,... Formices. \pyformex will interpret this script and draw what you have created. This is clearly very different than the traditional way of creating a model, like CAD. There are two huge advantages about using \pyformex:
\begin{itemize}
\item It is especially suited for the automated design of spatial frame structures. A dome, arc, hypar,... can be rather difficult to draw with CAD, but when using mathematical transformations, it becomes a piece of cake!
\item Using a script makes it very easy to apply changes in the geometry: you simply modify the script and let \pyformex play it again. For instance, you can easily change an angle, the radius of a dome, the ratio $f/l$ of an arc,... Using CAD, you would have to make an entirely new drawing! This is also illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:scallops}: these domes were all created with the same script, but with other values of the parameters.
\end{itemize}

% As mentioned, \pyformex is based on the programming language Python \footnote{\url{http://www.python.org}}. This implies that the scripts are also Python-based. It's a very easy language, but if you're interested in reading more, there is a very good tutorial available on \url{http://docs.python.org/tut/}. However, if you're only using Python to write \pyformex-scripts, the tutorial you're reading right now should be enough.

\section{Getting started}
\label{sec:getting-started}

This section holds some basic information on how to use Python and \pyformex. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Each script should begin with \Code{\#!/usr/bin/env python pyformex.py}
\item To start the \pyformex GUI, double click on the file \file{pyformex} in the installation directory, or type \emph{pyformex} in the terminal. Using the terminal can be very useful, because errors that are created while running the script will appear in the terminal. This can provide useful information when something goes wrong with your script.
\item To create a new \pyformex-script, just open a new file with your favorite text editor and save it as \file{myproject.py}.
\item To edit a script, you can
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Open it with your favorite text editor.
	\item \menuselection{File \sub Open}\\
	At this point, the script will be loaded but nothing will happen. \\
	\menuselection{File \sub Edit}\\
	The script will now open in the default text editor. This default editor can be changed in the user configuration file (\file{~/.pyformexrc}) or using the \menuselection{Settings \sub Commands} menu option.
	\end{itemize}
\item To play a script, you can
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \menuselection{File \sub Open}\\
		\menuselection{File \sub Play} 
	\item Type \emph{pyformex myproject.py} in the terminal. This will start the \pyformex GUI and load your script at the same time. \\
\menuselection{File \sub Play}
	\item To play a script without using the GUI (for example in finite element preprocessing, if you only want to write an 		output file, without drawing the structure), type \emph{pyformex --nogui myproject.py}
	\end{itemize}
\item When writing a script in Python, there are some things you should keep in mind:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item When using a function that requires arguments, an argument list must have any positional arguments followed by any keyword arguments, where the keywords must be chosen from the formal parameter names. It's not important whether a formal parameter has a default value or not. No argument may receive a value more than once -- formal parameter names corresponding to positional arguments cannot be used as keywords in the same calls. 

Simply put: you can either set the arguments in the right order and only give their value, or you can give arguments by their name and value. This last option holds some advantages: not only is it easier to check what you did, but sometimes a function has many arguments with default values and you only want to change a few.
If this isn't entirely clear yet, just look at the examples later in this tutorial or check the Python tutorial.
	\item Indentation is essential in Python. Indentation is Python's way of grouping statements. In straight-forward scripts, indentation is not needed (and forbidden!), but when using a for-statement for example, the body of the statement has to be indented. A small example might make this clear. Also notice the ':' 
\begin{verbatim}
	print 'properties'
	for key, item in properties.iteritems():
	    print key, item
\end{verbatim}
	\item If you want to use functions from a seperate module (like \module{properties}), you add a line on top of the script
\begin{verbatim}
	from properties import *
\end{verbatim}
All functions from that module are now available.
	\item The hash character, "\#", is used to start a comment in Python.
	\item Python is case sensative.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{The geometrical model}
\label{sec:geom}


\subsection{Creating a Formex}
\label{subsec:create}

\subsubsection{What is a Formex?}
A Formex\index{Formex} is a numarray of order 3 (axes 0,1,2) and type Float.
A scalar element represents a coordinate (F:uniple).

    A row along the axis 2 is a set of coordinates and represents a point
    (node, vertex, F: signet).
    For simplicity's sake, the current implementation only deals with points
    in a 3-dimensional space. This means that the length of axis 2 is always 3.
    The user can create Formices (plural of Formex) in a 2-D space, but
    internally these will be stored with 3 coordinates, by adding a third
    value 0. All operations work with 3-D coordinate sets. However, a method
    exists to extract only a limited set of coordinates from the results,
    permitting to return to a 2-D environment.

    A plane along the axes 2 and 1 is a set of points (F: cantle). This can be
    thought of as a geometrical shape (2 points form a line segment, 3 points
    make a triangle, ...) or as an element in FE terms. But it really is up to
    the user as to how this set of points is to be interpreted.

    Finally, the whole Formex represents a set of such elements.

    Additionally, a Formex may have a property set, which is an 1-D array of
    integers. The length of the array is equal to the length of axis 0 of the
    Formex data (i.e. the number of elements in the Formex). Thus, a single
    integer value may be attributed to each element. It is up to the user to
    define the use of this integer (e.g. it could be an index in a table of
    element property records).
    If a property set is defined, it will be copied together with the Formex
    data whenever copies of the Formex (or parts thereof) are made.
    Properties can be specified at creation time, and they can be set,
    modified or deleted at any time. Of course, the properties that are
    copied in an operation are those that exist at the time of performing
    the operation.   

Simply put: a Formex is a set of elements, and every element can have a property number.
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{makeimage}
  \end{makeimage}
  \begin{latexonly}
    \includegraphics{images/Formex}
  \end{latexonly}
  \begin{htmlonly}
    \htmladdimg{../images/Formex.png}
  \end{htmlonly}  
  \caption{The scheme of a Formex}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Creating a Formex using coordinates}
The first and most useful way to create a Formex is by specifying it's nodes and elements in a 3D-list.  

\begin{verbatim}
	F=Formex([[[0,0],[1,0],[1,1],[0,1]]])
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{makeimage}
  \end{makeimage}
  \begin{latexonly}
    \includegraphics[width=4cm]{images/square}
  \end{latexonly}
  \begin{htmlonly}
    \htmladdimg{../images/square.png}
  \end{htmlonly}  
  \caption{A very simple Formex}
  \label{fig:square}
\end{figure}

This creates a Formex F, which has the nodes (0,0), (1,0), (1,1) and (0,1). These nodes are all part of a single element, thus creating a square plane. This element is also the entire Formex.
On the other hand, if you would change the position of the square brackets like in the following example, then you'd create a Formex F which is different from the previous. The nodes are the same, but the connection is different. The nodes (0,0) and (1,0) are linked together by an element, and so are the nodes (1,1) and (0,1). The Formex is now a set of 2 parallel bars, instead of a single square plane. 
\begin{verbatim}
	F=Formex([[[0,0],[1,0]],[[1,1],[0,1]]])
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{makeimage}
  \end{makeimage}
  \begin{latexonly}
    \includegraphics[width=4cm]{images/parallel}
  \end{latexonly}
  \begin{htmlonly}
    \htmladdimg{../images/parallel.png}
  \end{htmlonly}  
  \caption{Same nodes, different Formex}
\end{figure}

If we want to define a Formex, similar to the square plane, but consisting of the 4 edges instead of the actual plane, we have to define four elements and combine them in a Formex. This is \emph{not} the same Formex as fig \ref{fig:square}, although it looks exactly the same.
\begin{verbatim}
	F=Formex([[[0,0],[0,1]], [[0,1],[1,1]], [[1,1],[1,0]], [[1,0],[0,0]]])
\end{verbatim}

The previous examples were limited to a 2-D environment for simplicity's sake. Of course, we could add a third dimension. For instance, it's no problem defining a pyramid consisting of 8 elements ('bars').
\begin{verbatim}
	F=Formex([[[0,0,0],[0,1,0]], [[0,1,0],[1,1,0]], [[1,1,0],[1,0,0]], [[1,0,0], 
		[0,0,0]], [[0,0,0],[0,1,0]], [[0,0,0],[0.5,0.5,1]], [[1,0,0],[0.5,0.5,1]], 
		[[1,1,0], [0.5,0.5,1]], [[0,1,0],[0.5,0.5,1]]])
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{makeimage}
  \end{makeimage}
  \begin{latexonly}
    \includegraphics[width=6cm]{images/pyramide}
  \end{latexonly}
  \begin{htmlonly}
    \htmladdimg{../images/pyramide.png}
  \end{htmlonly}  
  \caption{A pyramid}
  \label{fig:pyramid}
\end{figure}

However, as you can see, even in this very small example the number of nodes, elements and coordinates you have to declare becomes rather large. Defining large Formices using this method would not be practical. This problem is easily overcome by copying, translating, rotating,... a smaller Formex --- as will be explained in \ref{subsec:changing} --- or by using patterns.
 
\subsubsection{Creating a Formex using patterns}

The second way of creating a new Formex, is by defining patterns. In this case, a line segment pattern is created from a string.

The function \function{pattern(s)} creates a list of line segments where all nodes lie on the
gridpoints of a regular grid with unit step.
The first point of the list is [0,0,0]. Each character from the given
string \var{s} is interpreted as a code specifying how to move to the next node.
Currently defined are the following codes:\\
    0 = goto origin [0,0,0]\\
    1..8 move in the x,y plane\\
    9 remains at the same place\\
    When looking at the plane with the x-axis to the right,\\
    1 = East, 2 = North, 3 = West, 4 = South, 5 = NE, 6 = NW, 7 = SW, 8 = SE.\\
    Adding 16 to the ordinal of the character causes an extra move of +1 in
    the z-direction. Adding 48 causes an extra move of -1. This means that
    'ABCDEFGHI', resp. 'abcdefghi', correspond with '123456789' with an extra
    z +/-= 1.              
    The special character '\verb?\?' can be put before any character to make the
    move without making a connection.
    The effect of any other character is undefined.

This method has important restrictions, since it can only create lines on a regular grid. However, it can be a much easier and shorter way to define a simple Formex. This is illustrated by the difference in length between the previous creation of a square and the next one, although they define the same Formex (figure \ref{fig:square}).
\begin{verbatim}
	F=Formex(pattern('1234'))
\end{verbatim}

Some simple patterns are defined in \module{simple.py} and are ready for use. These patterns are stacked in a dictionary called 'Patterns'. Items of this dictionary can be accessed like \Code{Patterns['cube']}.
\begin{verbatim}
	#!/usr/bin/env pyformex
	from simple import *
	c=Formex(pattern(Pattern['cube']))
	clear();draw(c)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{makeimage}
  \end{makeimage}
  \begin{latexonly}
    \includegraphics[width=6cm]{images/cube}
  \end{latexonly}
  \begin{htmlonly}
    \htmladdimg{../images/cube.png}
  \end{htmlonly}  
  \caption{A cube}
  \label{fig:cube}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Creating a Formex using coordinates from a file}
In some cases, you might want to read coordinates from a file an combine them into a Formex. This is possible with the module \module{file2formex} and it's function \function{fileFormex()}. Each point is connected to the following, forming an element (bar).

The next file ('square.txt') would create the same square as before(figure \ref{fig:square}).
\begin{verbatim}
	0,0,0
	0,1,0
	1,1,0
	1,0,0
\end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}
	#!/usr/bin/env pyformex
	from file2formex import *
	F=fileFormex('square.text', closed='yes')
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Adding property numbers}
\label{subsec:propnr}
Besides the coordinates of its points, a Formex object can also hold a set of property numbers. These are a set integers, one for every element of the Formex.
The property numbers can be set, changed or deleted, and be used for any purpose the user wants. Just remember that a Formex either has no property numbers, or a set of numbers: one for every element.

Property numbers can play an important role in the modelling process, because they present some means of tracking how the resulting Formex was created. Indeed, each transformation of a Formex that preserves its structure, will also preserve the property numbers. Concatenation of Formices with property numbers will also concatenate the property numbers\footnote{If any of the concatenated Formices does not have property numbers, it will receive value 0 for all its elements.}
On transformation that change the  structure of the Formex, such as replication, each element of the created Formex will get the property number of Formex element it was generated from.



Each Formex element can have a property number. Each property number is represented by a different color when the Formex is drawn. This is the first reason why you could use property numbers: to make your drawing more transparent or just more beautiful. However, these numbers can also be used as an entry in a dictionary of properties - thus linking the element with a property. This property can be about anything, but in finite element processing this would be the element section, material, loads,... The use of properties in this way will be futher explained in \ref{sec:props}.
Property numbers can be specified at creation time, and they can be set, modified or deleted at any time.  
\begin{verbatim}
>>> #!/usr/bin/env pyformex
>>> F=Formex(pattern('1234'),[5])
>>> print F.prop()
>>> G=Formex(pattern('1234'),[6,8,2,4])
>>> print G.prop()
>>> F.setProp([6,7])
>>> print F.prop()
>>> G.setProp([6,7,8,9])
>>> print G.prop()

[5 5 5 5]
[6 8 2 4]
[6 7 6 7]
[6 7 8 9]
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Drawing a Formex}
\label{subsec:drawing}
Of course, you'd want to see what you have created. This is accomplished by the function \function{draw()}. The next example creates figure \ref{fig:pyramid}. 
\begin{verbatim}
	F=Formex([[[0,0,0],[0,1,0]], [[0,1,0],[1,1,0]], [[1,1,0],[1,0,0]], [[1,0,0], 
		[0,0,0]], [[0,0,0],[0,1,0]], [[0,0,0],[0.5,0.5,1]], [[1,0,0],[0.5,0.5,1]], 
		[[1,1,0], [0.5,0.5,1]], [[0,1,0],[0.5,0.5,1]]])
	draw(F)
\end{verbatim}

It also possible to draw multiple Formices at the same time.
\begin{verbatim}
	from simple import *
	F=Formex([[[0,0,0],[0,1,0]], [[0,1,0],[1,1,0]], [[1,1,0],[1,0,0]], [[1,0,0],
		[0,0,0]], [[0,0,0],[0,1,0]], [[0,0,0],[0.5,0.5,1]], [[1,0,0],[0.5,0.5,1]], 
		[[1,1,0],[0.5,0.5,1]], [[0,1,0],[0.5,0.5,1]]]).setProp(1)	
	G=Formex(pattern(Pattern['cube'])).setProp(3)
	draw(F+G)
\end{verbatim}
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{makeimage}
  \end{makeimage}
  \begin{latexonly}
    \includegraphics[width=6cm]{images/house}
  \end{latexonly}
  \begin{htmlonly}
    \htmladdimg{../images/house.png}
  \end{htmlonly}  
  \caption{Drawing multiple Formices}
  \label{fig:multiple}
\end{figure}
 
It might be important to realize that even if you don't draw a particular Formex, that doesn't mean you didn't create it!

Now, when you are creating a large geometry, you might be interested in seeing the different steps in the creation. To remove all previously drawn Formices, you can use \function{clear()}  what sweepes the screen clean. If you want to see a certain step in the creation longer than the default time, use \function{sleep(t)}, with \var{t} the delay (in seconds) before executing the next command.
\begin{verbatim}
	F=Formex(pattern('164'))
	draw(F)
	G=F.replic(5,1,0)
	clear()
	draw(G)
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{Saving images}
\label{subsec:images}
After drawing the Formex, you might want to save the image. This is very easy to do:\\
\menuselection{File \sub Save Image}\\
The filetype should be 'bmp', 'jpg', 'pbm', 'png', 'ppm', 'xbm', 'xpm', 'eps', 'ps', 'pdf' or 'tex'. \\
To create a better looking picture, several settings can be changed:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Change the background color \menuselection{Settings \sub Background Color}
	\item Use a different (bigger) linewidth \menuselection{Settings \sub Linewidth}
	\item Change the canvas size. This prevents having to cut and rescale the figure with an image manipulation program (and loosing quality by doing so).  \menuselection{Settings \sub Canvas Size}
\end{itemize}

It is also possible to save a series of images. This can be especially useful when playing a script which creates several images, and you would like to save them all.  For example, figure \ref{fig:WireStent-steps}, which shows the different steps in the creation of the WireStent model, was created this way.\\
\menuselection{File \sub Toggle MultiSave}\\


\subsection{Information about a Formex}
\label{subsec:info}
There are a number of functions available that return information about a Formex. Especially when using \pyformex as finite element preprocessor, the most useful functions are:
\begin{tableii}{l|l}{exception}{Function}{Description}
	\lineii{F.nelems()			}
		{Return the number of elements in the Formex.}
	\lineii{F.nnodes() 			}
		{Return the number of nodes in the Formex.}
	\lineii{F.prop() 				}
		{Return the properties as a numpy array.}
	\lineii{F.bbox()				}
		{Return the bounding box of the Formex.}
	\lineii{F.center()			}
		{Return the center of the Formex.}
	\lineii{F.feModel()	}
		{Return a tuple of nodal coordinates and element connectivity.}
\end{tableii}

\function{feModel()} is very important in finite element processing. It returns all nodes and all elements of the Formex in a format useful for FE processing. A tuple of two arrays is returned. The first is float array with the coordinates of the unique nodes of the Formex. The second is an integer array with the node numbers connected by each element.
\begin{verbatim}
>>> #!/usr/bin/env pyformex
>>> from simple import *

>>> c = Formex(pattern(Pattern['cube']))
>>> draw(c)
>>> nodes,elems = c.feModel()
>>> print 'Nodes'
>>> print nodes
>>> print 'Elements'
>>> print elems

\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Changing the Formex}
\label{subsec:changing}
Until now, we've only created simple Formices. The strength of \pyformex however is that it is very easy to generate large geometrical models by a sequence of mathematical transformations. After initiating a basic Formex, it's possible to transform it by using copies, translations, rotations, projections,...

There are many transformations available, but this is not the right place to describe them all. This is what the reference manual in chapter \ref{cha:reference} is for. A summary of all possible transformations and functions can be found there.

To illustrate some of these transformations and the recommended way of writing a script, we will analyse some of the examples. More of these interesting examples are found in \file{installdir/examples}. Let's begin with the example \file{Spiral.py}. 

\verbatiminput{scripts/Spiral.py}

During this first read-through, you will have noticed that every step is drawn. Of course, this is not necessary, but it can be useful. And above all, it is very educational for use in a tutorial...

The next important thing is that parameters were used. It's recommended to always do this, especially when you want to do a parametric study of course, but it can also be very convenient if at some point you want to change the geometry (for example when you want to re-use the script for another application).

A simple function \function{drawit()} is defined for use in this script only. This function only provides a shorter way of drawing Formices, since it combines \function{clear()} and \function{draw}. 

Now, let's dissect the script.

\begin{verbatim}
def drawit(F,view='front'):
    clear()
    draw(F,view)
\end{verbatim}
This is a small function that is only defined in this script. It clears the screen and draws the Formex at the same time. 

\begin{verbatim}
m = 36 # number of cells along torus big circle
n = 10 # number of cells along torus small circle
\end{verbatim}
These are the parameters. They can easily be changed, and a whole new spiral will be created without any extra effort.
The first step is to create a basic Formex. In this case, it's a triangle which has a different property number for every edge.
\begin{verbatim}
F = Formex(pattern("164"),[1,2,3]); drawit(F)  
\end{verbatim}
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{makeimage}
  \end{makeimage}
  \begin{latexonly}
    \includegraphics[width=6cm]{images/spiral-000}
  \end{latexonly}
  \begin{htmlonly}
    \htmladdimg{../images/spiral-000.png}
  \end{htmlonly}  
  \caption{The basic Formex}
\end{figure}

This basic Formex is copied 'm' times in the 0-direction with a translation 
step of '1' (the length of an edge of the triangle). After that, the new 
Formex is copied 'n' times in the 1-direction with a translation step of '1'. 
Because of the recursive definition (F=F.replic), the original Formex F is 
overwritten by the transformed one.
\begin{verbatim}
F = F.replic(m,1,0); drawit(F)
F = F.replic(n,1,1); drawit(F)
\end{verbatim}

Now a copy of this last Formex is translated in direction '2' with a 
translation step of '1'. This necessary for the transformation into a cilinder.
The result of all previous steps is a rectangular pattern with the desired 
dimensions, in a plane z=1.
\begin{verbatim}
F = F.translate(2,1); drawit(F,'iso')
\end{verbatim}
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{makeimage}
  \end{makeimage}
  \begin{latexonly}
    \includegraphics[width=6cm]{images/spiral-003}
  \end{latexonly}
  \begin{htmlonly}
    \htmladdimg{../images/spiral-003.png}
  \end{htmlonly}  
  \caption{The rectangular pattern}
\end{figure}

This pattern is rolled up into a cilinder around the 2-axis. 
\begin{verbatim}
F = F.cylindrical([2,1,0],[1.,360./n,1.]); drawit(F,'iso')
\end{verbatim}

This cilinder is copied 5 times in the 2-direction with a translation step of 
'm' (the lenght of the cilinder). 
\begin{verbatim}
F = F.replic(5,m,2); drawit(F,'iso')
\end{verbatim}

The next step is to rotate this cilinder -10 degrees around the 0-axis. 
This will determine the pitch angle of the spiral.
\begin{verbatim}
F = F.rotate(-10,0); drawit(F,'iso')
\end{verbatim}

\end{figure}

This last Formex is now translated in direction '0' with a translation step of '5'. 
\begin{verbatim}
F = F.translate(0,5); drawit(F,'iso')
\end{verbatim}

Finally, the Formex is rolled up, but around a different axis then before. 
Due to the pitch angle, a spiral is created. If the pitch angle would be 0 
(no rotation of -10 degrees around the 0-axis), the resulting Formex 
would be a torus. 
\begin{verbatim}
F = F.cylindrical([0,2,1],[1.,360./m,1.]); drawit(F,'iso')
drawit(F,'right')

\section{Assigning properties to geometry}
\label{sec:props}
\emph{As of version 0.7.1, the way to define properties for elements of the geometry has changed thoroughly. As a result, the proprty system has become much more flexibel and powerful, and can be used for Formex data structures as well as for TriSurfaces and Finite Element models.}

With properties we mean any data connected with some part of the geometry other than the coordinates of its points or the structure of points into elements.
Also, values that can be calculated purely from the coordinates of the points and the structure of the elements are usually not considerer properties.

Properties can e.g. define material characteristics, external loading and boundary conditions to be used in numerical simulations of the mechanics of a structure. The properties module includes some specific functions to facilitate assigning such properties. But the system is general enough to used it for any properties that you can think of.

Properties are collected in a \class{PropertyDB} object. Before you can store anything in this database, you need to create it. Usually, you will start with an empty database.
\begin{verbatim}
P = PropertyDB()
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{General properties}
\label{sec:general-properties}

Now you can start entering property records into the database. A property record is a lot like a Python dict object, and thus it can contain nearly anything. It is implemented however as a \class{CascadingDict} object, which means that the key values are strings and can also be used as attributes to address the value. Thus, if \Code{P} is a property record, then a field named \Code{key} can either be addressed as \Code{P['key']} or as \Code{P.key}. This implementation was choosen for the convenience of the user, but has no further advantages over a normal dict object. You should not use any of the methods of Python's dict class as key in a property record: it would override this method for the object.

The property record has four more reserved (forbidden) keys: \Code{kind}, \Code{tag}, \Code{set} and \code{nr}. The \Code{kind} and \Code{nr} should never be set nor changed by the user. \Code{kind} is used internally to distinguish among different kind of property records (see \ref{sec:node-properties}). It should only be used to extend the \class{PropertyDB} class with new kinds of properties, e.g. in subclasses. \Code{nr} will be set automatically to a unique record number. Some application modules use this number for identification and to create automatic names for property sets. 

The \Code{tag} and \Code{set} keys are optional fields and can be set by the user. They should however only be used for the purposes explained hereafter, because they have a special meaning for the database methods and application modules. The \Code{set} can be used to specify a list of integer numbers identifying a collection of elements of the geometry for which the current property is valid. Absence of the \Code{set} means that the property is assigned to all elements. The \Code{tag} field can be used to attach an identification string to the property record. THis string can be as complex as the user wants and its interpretation is completely left to the user. The \class{ProeprtyDB} class just provides an easy way to select the records by their \Code{tag} name or by a set of tag names.  
So let's create a property record in our database. The \Code{Prop()} method does just that. It also returns the property record, so you can directly use it further in your code.
\begin{verbatim}
>>> Stick = P.Prop(colour='green',name='Stick',weight=25, \
        comment='This could be anything: a gum, a frog, a usb-stick,...'})
>>> print Stick

  color = green
  comment = This could be anything: a gum, a frog, a usb-stick,...
  nr = 0
  name = Stick
  weight = 25
\end{verbatim}
Notice the auto-generated \Code{nr} field. Here's another example, with a tag:
\begin{verbatim}
>>> author = P.Prop(tag='author',name='Alfred E Neuman',address=CascadingDict({'street':'Krijgslaan', 'city':'Gent','country':'Belgium'}))
>>> print author

  nr = 1
  tag = author
  name = Alfred E Neuman
  address = 
    city = Gent
    street = Krijgslaan
    country = Belgium
\end{verbatim}
This example shows that record values can be complex structured objects.
Notice how the \class{CascadingDict} object is by default printed in a very readible layout, offsetting each lower level dictionary two more postions to the right. 

The \class{CascadingDict} has yet another fine characteristic: if an attribute is not found in the toplevel, all values that are instances of \class{CascadingDict} or \class{Dict} (but not the normal Python dict) will be searched for the attribute. If needed, this searching is even repeated in the values of the next levels, and further on, thus cascading though all levels of \class{CascadingDict} structures until the attribute can eventually be found. The cascading does not proceed through values in a \class{Dict}.

If you set an attribute of a \class{CascadingDict}, it is always set in the toplevel. If you want to change lower level attributes, you need to use the full path to it.
\begin{verbatim}
>>> print author.street
  Krijgslaan
>>> author.street = 'Voskenslaan'
>>> print author.street
  Voskenslaan
>>> print author.address.street
  Krijgslaan
>>> author.address.street = 'Wiemersdreef'
>>> print author.address.street
  Wiemersdreef
>>> author = P.Prop(tag='author',alias='John Doe',address={'city': 'London', 'street': 'Downing Street 10', 'country': 'United Kingdom'})
>>> print author

  nr = 2
  tag = author
  alias = John Doe
  address = {'city': 'London', 'street': 'Downing Street 10', 'country': 'United Kingdom'} 
\end{verbatim}

In the examples above, we have given a name to the created property records, so that we could address them in the subsequent print and field assigment statements. In most cases however, it will be impractical and unnecessary to give your records a name. They all are recorded in the \class{PropertyDB} database, and will exist as long as the database variable lives. There should be away though to request selected data from that database. The \method{getProp()} method returns a list of records satisfying some conditions. The examples below show how it can be used.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> for p in P.getProp(rec=[0,2]):
        print p.name
Stick
John Doe
>>>  for p in P.getProp(tag=['author']):
        print p.name
None
John Doe
>>>  for p in P.getProp(attr=['name']):
        print p.nr
0
2
>>>  for p in P.getProp(tag=['author'],attr=['name']):
        print p.name
John Doe
\end{verbatim}
The first call selects records by number: either a single record number or a list of numbers can be specified. The second method selects records based on the value of their tag field. Again a single tag value or a list of values can be specified. Only those records having a 'tag' filed matching any of the values in the list will be returned. The third selection method is based on the existence of some attribute names in the record. Here, always a list of attribute names is required. Records are returned that posess all the attributes in the list, independent from the value of those attributes. If needed, the user can add a further filtering based on the attribute values. Finally, as is shown in the last example, all methods of record selection can be combined. Each extra condition will narrow the selection further down.


\section{Node properties}
\label{sec:node-properties}

The property system presented above allows for recording any kind of values. In many situations however we will want to work with a specialised and limited set of attributes. The main developers of \pyf e.g. often use the program to create geometrical models of structures of which they want to analyse the mechanical behavior. These numerical simulations (FEA, CFD) require specific data that support the introduction of specialised property records. Currently there are two such property record types: node properties, which are attributed to a single point in space, and element properties (see section \ref{sec:elem-properties}), which are attributed to a structured collection of points.

Special purpose properties are distincted by their \Code{kind} field. General property records have {\Code{kind=''}, node properties haven {\Code{kind='n'} and 
 {\Code{kind='e'} is set for element properties. Users can create their own specialised property records by using other value for the \Code{kind} parameter.

Node properties are created with the \method{nodeProp} method, rather than the general \method{Prop}. The \Code{kind} field does not need to be set: it will be done automatically. When selecting records using the \method{getProp} method, add a \Code{kind='n'} argument to select only node properties.

Node properties will recognize some special field names and check the values for consistency. Application plugins such as the Abaqus input file generator depend on these property structure, so the user should not mess with them. Currently, the following attributes are in use:
\begin{description}
 \item [cload] A concentrated load at the node. This is a list of 6 items: three force components in axis directions and three force moments around the axes: \Code{[F_0, F_1, F_2, M_0, M_1, M_2]}. 
 \item [bound] A boundary condition for the nodal displacement components. This can be defined in 2 ways:
     \begin{itemize}
     \item as a list of 6 items \Code{[ u_0, u_1, u_2, r_0, r_1, r_2 ]}. These items have 2 possible values:
         \begin{description}
         \item [0] The degree of freedom is not restrained.
         \item [1] The degree of freedom is restrained.
         \end{description}
     \item as a string. This string is a standard boundary type. Abaqus will recognize the following strings:
         \begin{itemize}
         \item PINNED 
         \item ENCASTRE
         \item XSYMM
         \item YSYMM
         \item ZSYMM
         \item XASYMM
         \item YASYMM 
         \item ZASYMM
         \end{itemize} 
     \end{itemize}
 \item [displacement] Prescribed displacements. This is a list of tuples (i,v), where i is a DOF number (1..6) and v is the prescribed value for that DOF. 
 \item [coords] The coordinate system which is used for the definition of cload, bound and displ fields. It should be a \class{CoordSys} object.
\end{description}

Some simple examples:
\begin{verbatim}
    P.nodeProp(cload=[5,0,-75,0,0,0])
    P.nodeProp(set=[2,3],bound='pinned')
    P.nodeProp(5,displ=[(1,0.7)])
\end{verbatim}
The first line sets a concentrated load all the nodes, the second line sets a boundary condition 'pinned' on nodes 2 and 3. The third line sets a prescribed displacement on node 5 with value 0.7 along the first direction.
The first positional argument indeed corresponds to the 'set' attribute.

Often the properties are computed and stored in variables rather than entered directly. To facilitate property selection, a tag can be added.
\begin{verbatim}
    B1 = [ 1 ] + [ 0 ] * 5
    CYL = CoordSystem('cylindrical',[0,0,0,0,0,1])
    P1 = [ 1.0,1.0,1.0, 0.0,0.0,0.0 ]
    P2 = [ 0.0 ] * 3 + [ 1.0 ] * 3 
    P.nodeProp(cload=P1,bound=B1,csys=CYL)
    nset1 = P.nodeProp(tag='loadcase 1',set=[2,3,4],cload=P1).nr
    P.nodeProp(tag='loadcase 2',set=Nset(nset1),cload=P2)
\end{verbatim}
The last two lines show how you can avoid duplication of sets in mulitple records. The same set of nodes should receive different concentrated load values for different load cases. The load case is stored in a tag, but duplicating the set definition could become wasteful if the sets are large. Instead of specifying the node numbers of the set directly, we can pass a string setting a set name.

Of course, the application will need to know how to interprete the set names.
Therefore the property module provides a unified way to attach a unique set name to each set defined in a property record. The name of a node property record set can be obtained with the function \Code{Nset(nr)}, where nr is the record number. In the example above, that value is first recorded in \Code{nset1} and then used in the last line to guarantee the use of the same set as in the property above.


\section{Element properties}
\label{sec:elem-properties}



\emph{The rest of this section is obsolete}



\subsection{The class ElemProperty}
The class ElemProperty holds properties related to a single element. The data is stored in a Dict called 'elemproperties'. An element property can hold the following sub-properties:
\begin{description}
\item [elemsection] The section properties of the element. This is an ElemSection instance.
\item [elemload] The loading of the element. This is a list of ElemLoad instances.
\item [elemtype] The type of element that is to be used in the analysis. 
\end{description}

An elemsection can hold the following sub-properties:
\begin{description}
\item [section] The section properties of the element. This can be a dictionary or a string. The required data in this dict depends on the sectiontype. 
\item [material] The element material properties. This can be a dictionary which holds these properties or a string which can be used to search a material database. 
\item [sectiontype] The sectiontype of the element. 
\item [orientation]  A list [First direction cosine, second direction cosine, third direction cosine] of the first beam section axis. This allows to change the orientation of the cross-section.
\end{description}

An element load can hold the following sub-properties:
\begin{description}
\item [magnitude] The magnitude of the distibuted load.
\item [loadlabel] The distributed load type label.
\end{description}

The overview of the current property database structure is:
\begin{itemize}
