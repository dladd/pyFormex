Collection of changes since pyFormex release 0.4
================================================
- config.py:
  Configuration files now can have continuation lines, flagged by \

GUI:
====
- image saving:
   - option settings gathered in a single dialog
   - auto mode saves a new image at each draw() operation
   - option to save full pyFormex window

- when starting multiple pyFormex instances, windows are named differently 

- user menus (see Stl.py and Formex.py plugins)

- appearance dialog to set the widget Style and Font 

- toggle between perspective/projective display now works


- formex.py:
  - removed the equal() function: use numpy's allclose() instead.
  - added a function roll() for compatibility with older numpy not
    providing it.
  - removed unique() because numpy provides it
  - added new functions:  isClose(), boundingBox(), 
    vectorPairAreaNormals(), vectorPairNormals(), vectorPairArea()
  - merged rotateMatrix and rotateAboutMatrix

  Formex class:
  - setProp has no longer a default value. If called with a value None,
    the property numbers are removed.
  - removeProp is deprecated: replace with setProp(None)

  - nodesAndElements is renamed feModel (the old name still exists but is
    deprecated). This method now has two optional arguments rtol and atol
    to set the relative and absolute tolerance for deciding on equal 
    coordinates. The default atol has been set to 1.e-5 to be in better
    accordance with the single precision. 

  - the arguments xmin, xmax of the where() method have been renamed min, max

  - translate and translate1 have been merged into a single method

  - rotate and rotateAround have been merged into a single methode
    rotate will also accept a roation matrix as argument

  - shrink(factor) shrinks all elements in the Formex by a factor

  - fixed the bug in connect() when loop=True and bias != 0

  - interpolate (F,G,[v]) : interpolates between Formices F and G at values v

  - divide(a,[v]) : divide all elements of a plex-2 Formex at values v

  - the order and interpretation of the spherical coordinates in the methods
    spherical and toSpherical has changed! Spherical coordinates are now
    (longitude, latitude, radius). There is an extra parameter colat, which
    can be set True to use colatitude istead of latitude.
    For convenience, we provide the method oldspherical, which still works
    as the old spherical.

  - write() and read() methods provide access to a native file format for
    persistent storage of Formices.

- draw.py:
  - draw(F) now also accepts a string. If it is the name of an object in
    globals(), that object is drawn.
  - all Formices created during the run of a script are now exported by default
    This can be undone by setting GD.cfg['autoglobals'] to False
  - flyAlong (path): move the camera along path. Each element of path is a 
    couple of two points : camera position and point to look at. 
    In autosave mode an image is saved at each camera position.


- widgets.py:
  - added Selection dialog to select items from a list
  - renamed InputDialog.process() to getResult() for consistency


- Manual:
  - installation instructions
  - Some additions to reference manual


KNOWN PROBLEMS:
--------------
 - With the mouse zoom function, you can not zoom beyond the center of the
   displayed scene. (You can do it using the zoom buttons)
 - Mouse zooming does not work correctly in projective mode.
 - Mouse zooming will make a jump after a flyAlong().
