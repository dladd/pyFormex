This is the IDEAS file for the pyFormex project.

This file holds some ideas for (minor) improvements that we
will try to implement in the future releases. 
There is no guarantee that the tasks mentioned here will indeed be completed
in time (if ever!). It is mainly intended for the developers, to see who is
working on what.


Each task can have the following keys:
 dev(eloper)
 sta(tus)
 rem(arks)

 - Add the viewport background color choice to configurations or settings
     dev: ?
     sta: TODO
     rem: An obvious extension would be to link this setting of the main viewport
     to all windows in multiple viewport status
