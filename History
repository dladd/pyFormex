2006-04-15 BV: Released pyFormex 0.3

2006: pyFormex was used in some of our research projects and proved to be
      a valuable tool. This necessitated and inspired new development work
      on pyFormex. Lots of new features were implemented, too many to be
      listed here.
      Some of the milestones:
      - pyFormex was used in the design of wire stents (see WireStent example).
        The process involved the automatic creation of Finite Element
        Analysis jobs and automatic processing of the results.
      - pyFormex was used to measure geometries obtained from medical images
        and to create a patient specific geometrical hardware model. This
        initiated our further work with surface models.
      - pyFormex was used by civil engineering students for their projects
        in designing shell structures. Some of these will be included as
        examples in future releases. 


2005-12-09 BV : First anniversary release 0.2.2
2005-12-06 BV : Lots of changes have been made since the 0.2.1 release.
                The pyformex program has been split over multiple files and
                a large code cleanup is underway.
                Lots of examples have been added, some of them illustrating
                the practical use of pyFormex by linking it to structural
		analysis codes.
