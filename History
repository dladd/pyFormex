               to the Qt4 widget set.

2006-04-15 BV: Released pyFormex 0.3

2006: pyFormex was used in some of our research projects and proved to be
      a valuable tool. This necessitated and inspired new development work
      on pyFormex. Lots of new features were implemented, too many to be
      listed here.
      Some of the milestones:
      - pyFormex was used in the design of wire stents (see WireStent example).
        The process involved the automatic creation of Finite Element
        Analysis jobs and automatic processing of the results.
      - pyFormex was used to measure geometries obtained from medical images
        and to create a patient specific geometrical hardware model. This
        initiated our further work with surface models.
      - pyFormex was used by civil engineering students for their projects
        in designing shell structures. Some of these will be included as
        examples in future releases.
