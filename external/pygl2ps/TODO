------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Add an option to limit the recursion level depth in BSP tree

------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Add an simple option to subdivide long, stretched triangles so that
  SIMPLE_SORT can still be used for simple, non-intersecting geometries
  (cf. Olivier Couet's long cylinders at Cern) where BSP_SORT is very
  slow due to the presence of many, many curved surfaces

------------------------------------------------------------------------

* do we really need gl2psEnable(GL2PS_BLEND)? Couldn't we just check
  what's in rgba[3] and try to do the "right thing" right away?
  Update Thu Jul 20 14:51:33 2006: that's what I do now for SVG and it
  works pretty well. We could probably significantly simplify the PDF
  code that way.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Think about a way to provide a progress indicator through a
  callback. Not easy for BSP trees due to the recursive
  implementation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Apple's Preview.app doesn't support '/ShadingType 4'... Submit a bug 
  report to Apple?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Escape special characters?

Now that you mention it I could see where some may want to do this.

I have not used your LaTeX ouput option so I am not sure how this would 
effect it.
