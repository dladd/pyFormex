=================================

Tetgen is a quality tetrahedral mesh generator and three-dimensional Delaunay 
triangulator.
Website: http://tetgen.berlios.de/

pyFormex has a number of functions that interface with tetgen.
To help our users with installing the tetgen program, we provide the 
'tetgen.install' procedure in this directory.

tetgen.install will download, compile and install tetgen and all that is
needed to let it cooperate with pyFormex.

By default the installation is done under /usr/local and you will need root
privileges to do so.

The full installation can be done with a single command (as root):
./tetgen.install all
