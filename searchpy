Usage: searchpy [-a] [OPTION]... SEARCH
       changepy [-a] [OPTION]... SEARCH TARGET REPLACE

searchpy searches for a string SEARCH in all Python files of pyFormex
and possibly in other configured (Python or other) files. 
It displays the matching file names and lines.

changepy searches the same files for SEARCH, and in all matching lines 
it replaces the string TARGET with REPLACE.

Options:
-a : Should be the first and a separate option: if specified, the directories
     specified in the user configuration file (searchpy.conf) will also be
     searched. The searchpy.conf file holds a line myfiles=... with same
     format as files=... in this script.
