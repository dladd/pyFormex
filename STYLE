# STYLE
#
# This file holds some recommendations about the style to be used for
# pyFormex development and the use of the subversion repository.
#

- Make sure the following is in your subversion configuration 
  (~/.subversion/config):

global-ignores = *~ *.pyc
use-commit-times = yes
enable-auto-props = yes
[auto-props]
*.py = svn:eol-style=native;svn:keywords=Id

- Name of .py files should be only lowercase.
- Start .py files with the following two lines:

#!/usr/bin/env python
# $Id: $

- .py files should end with a section

if __name__ == "__main__":

  followed by whatever is needed to test the functionality of the module

- exported names should preferably follow the convention:
  - all lowercase for (global) variable names
  - lowerUpperUpper for function names
  - UpperUpperUpper for class names
