HOWTO for pyFormex developers:       -*- outline-*-
==============================
(Hint: this file can best be viewed/edited with GNU/Emacs)

* Things that can be done by any developer

** Create the manual

You need to install the following packages (on debian):
  python-dev
  latex2html

In the main pyformex directory (svn tree) do:
  make manual
This will generate: 
  - PDF version:  manual/manual.pdf
  - PS version:   manual/manual.ps
  - HTML version: manual/html/

            
** Create a distribution

In the main pyformex directory (svn tree) do:
  make dist
This will create a pyformex-${VERSION}.tar.gz in dist/


** Create/change your local subversion tree

*** checkout the current subversion archive in a subdir 'pyformex'
svn co svn+ssh://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/pyformex/trunk pyformex

*** create a branch 'mybranch' of the current subversion archive
svn copy svn+ssh://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/pyformex/trunk svn+ssh://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/pyformex/branches/mybranch -m "Creating a branch for some purpose"

*** change your local directory to another branch:
svn switch svn+ssh://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/pyformex/branches/mybranch


* Things that are (currently) for project manager only

** Make a distribution available on our own FTP server
  make pub


** Release a distribution to the general public

!! First test that make manual, make dist, and install work fine !! 

Set the version in RELEASE and then
  make version
Stamp the files with the version
  make stampall
Check in (creating the dist may modify some files)
  svn ci -m "Creating release ..."
Create a Tag
  make tag
Create a distribution
  make dist
Put the file on berlios ftp server
  ftp ftp.berlios.de
  name: ftp (anoniem)
  cd incoming
  lcd dist
  put fullfilename
Release the file via project administration
  inloggen
  project
  admin
  edit/release files
  QRS: quick release a file
    Release: vb: 0.4.2
    Select a file
    File type : source gz
    Processor type :Any
    Release Notes
  Release file
Announce the release on the pyFormex news
  news
  submit
    >> text: pyFormex Version released....
Make the release available on our local FTP server
  make publocal
Bump the RELEASE and VERSION variables in the file RELEASE, then
  make version
  svn ci -m 'Bump version after release'


(That was easy, uh?)
