pyFormex 0.2.1 - release notes

While we are still far from the 0.3 release, there have been so much
changes and added funtionality that we thaught we should no longer
keep these away from the user. Therefore, we prepared this interim release.

Most notable changes:

- lots of GUI improvements
- new functionality like recursive growth formalisms and turtle graphics
- help viewer framework (the real documentation still needs to be written)
- more examples
- start of program configuration framework
