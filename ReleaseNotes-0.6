The implementation of the Formex class has changed drastically!!

The coordinates and most of the methods that only deal with coordinate
information are now implemented by a new class Coords, defined in coords.py.
This was done so that the Coords class and all its transformations can be 
reused in other data structures, such as (geometric) surfaces or Finite Element
models.

The Coords class is a subclass of numpy's ndarray, so that all
numeric array processing can be applied on a Coords object.
The class is somewhat more general than the former Formex coords attribute:
the shape of a Coords array can be anything if only the last axis has a length
of 3.

While this change is a very important one, we have tried to keep the changes 
to Formex API minimal. This means that user scripts will only rarely need to 
be changed (and only if you directly accessed the coordinates attribute f).
 

- formex.py:
  
  The distanceFrom... (Plane,Line,Point) functions were turned into Formex
  class methods. The function versions are deprecated and will be removed
  in future.

  Formex class:
    - distanceFromPlane(p,n), distanceFromLine(p,n), distanceFromPoint(p)
 
- draw.py:
  removed about(): use info() instead
  added question()

- widgets.py:

  InputDialog: The 2nd and 4th field of the 'select' type have been switched.
