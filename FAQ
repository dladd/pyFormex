2. Why is pyFormex written in Python? Isn't it slow?
----------
Because
 - it is very easy to learn (See www.python.org)
 - it is extremely powerful (More on www.python.org)
As a scripting language, it allows for quick program development.
And because it provides so many plugins to libraries implemented in 
C or Fortran, it can be surprisingly fast.
