This documentation has been automatically generated by pydoc from the pyFormex sources. It is mainly intended as a reference document for developers.<br/>

If you are looking for information on how to use pyFormex, you should consult the <a href="../../manual/html/index.html">pyFormex User Manual</a>. While still under development, it already provides a lot of useful information.<br/>

The most up-to-date information will of course always be the source files themselves.
