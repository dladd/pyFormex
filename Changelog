# This file collects most important changes between releases

Release 0.3:
============

	
	
Release 0.2.2:
==============
	
pyformex command line parameters:
--------------------------------
- parameters not recognized by pyformex and/or Qt are considered to be
  filenames of scripts, and will be executed (if existing and accessible)

pyformex FUNCTIONS:
-------------------	
- the exit() function can be used in scripts. It will exit from the script.
  Using exit() in interactive mode will close the GUI and exit the program.
- the file menu has a multiSave option: When activating this option, you can
	save subsequent images by just hitting the 's' key. Each image will be
	saved on a file with an increasing numerical part just before the
	extension. You are asked once for a file name on activating the option.
	If the supplied filename already contains a numerical part, it will
	be used. Otherwise, a numerical part will be added. Thus on specifying
	'image.png', subsequently saved images will be named 'image-000.png,
	'image-001.png', ... If you specify a name 'image09.png, next saves
	will go to 'image09.png', 'image10.png'.
- default view in draw operations is the last view

	
formex.py:
----------
	
Formex class:
-------------
- allow Formex("string") as a shorthand for Formex(pattern("string")) in 
  initializing a Formex
- added function select(), affine()
- BoundingBox now returns a list instead of an array
- individual Formex elements can be changed by a syntax such as
	 F[i] = [[1,2,3],[1,2,4]]
  USE CAREFULLY THOUGH!!
- replicate: renamed to replic
- generate2: renamed to replic2, changed order of arguments has, introduced
	default values 0,1 for directions.
