- The `stent research group`_ at IBiTech-bioMMeda hosts several developers and users of pyFormex.
- `IBiTech-bioMMeda`_ is their parent research group.
- `IBiTech, Ghent University`_ is the hosting institute.
- The `BuMPer cluster`_ is their very own HPC solution and hosts a version of pyFormex for non-interactive use.
- The `Vascular Modeling Toolkit`_ (vmtk) provides complimentary tools to pyFormex.
- `FEops`_, a young company providing professional services with pyFormex, also offers training and support for pyFormex.  
- `Numpy`_ is a framework for efficient numerical array operations in
  Python. It is the most important component on which pyFormex was built.
