pyFormex 0.5  Releasenotes 
============

This is a collection of the most prominent changes in pyFormex 0.5
(compared to the prevous release 0.4.2)

INSTALLATION
============
  The install procedure now uses the Python Distutils. There is also a
  procedure to remove the installation.


COMMAND LINE
============
    If pyformex is started with a script name, it defaults to the --nogui
    version. If pyformex is started without filename, it defaults to --gui.

    pyformex --whereami shows where the program is installed
    pyformex --remove removes the installation

  The --multiview command line option is no longer needed and has been removed.



GUI:
====
- Multiple views functionality is now always activated.
- Many functions were regrouped more logically.
- Many new configuration and customization possibilities
- Many widgets have been greatly improved and restructured to offer easier
  user access. 


CORE:
=====
- formex.py:
  
  - norm(v,n=2): Return a norm of the vector v.
  - vectorNormalize(vec): Normalize a set of vectors

  Some interesting new algorythms (currently available both as functions 
  and as Formex methods): 
  - intersectionWithPlane(F,p,n): Return the intersection of a Formex F with
    the plane (p,n).
  - intersectionPointsWithPlane(F,p,n): Return the intersection points of a 
    Formex with plane p,n
  - intersectionLinesWithPlane(F,p,n): Returns the intersection lines of a 
    Formex with plane (p,n).
  - cutAtPlane(F,p,n): Return all elements of the Formex cut at plane.
  - cut3AtPlane(F,p,n): Returns all elements of the Formex cut at plane.
 
  Formex class: 
    - Now implemented as a Python new-style class (derived from object)
    - A Formex may be initialized with a 2-dimensional array: It will be
      interpreted as a Formex with plexitude 1 (collection of points).
    - divide() method replaces the divide(F) function
    - rotate accepts an optional around=.. argument to rotate around a point
      different from the origin
    - new centroid() method, returns the point with mean coordinates
    - test() has been generalized to test on distance from planes with
      general orientation and position
    - rollaxes() rolls the coordinate axes
    - projectOnSphere() projects a Formex on a sphere
    - split() splits a Formex in its elements
    - data() renamed to view()

- draw.py:
  - Drawing a plex-1 Formex now shows points as fixed size dots. The old
    behavior of drawing 3D colored cubes (that follow rotations and scaling)
    can still be achieved by specifying 'eltype=point3d' as an argument in the
    draw() instruction.

  - Started implementing transparent rendering. This offers a dramatical
    improvement in the representation of complex geometries.


MANUAL:
=======
  - Is continuously being expanded.
