Collection of changes since pyFormex release 0.4.2 (revision 240)

(See ReleaseNotes-0.4.2 for earlier changes)
==================================================

- command line:

- config.py:

GUI:
====
#- Multiple views functionality is now always activated.
#  The --multiview command line option is unneeded and will be removed in
#  a future release.

- formex.py:

  Formex class: 
    - Now implemented as a Python new-style class (derived from object)
    - A Formex may be initialized with a 2-dimensional array: It will be
      interpreted as a Formex with plexitude 1 (collection of points).
    - divide() method replaces the divide(F) function
    - rotate accepts an optional around=.. argument to rotate around a point
      different from the origin
    - new centroid() method, returns the point with mean coordinates

- draw.py:
  - Drawing a plex-1 Formex now shows points as fixed size dots. The old
    behavior of drawing 3D colored cubes (that follow rotations and scaling)
    can still be achieved by specifying 'eltype=point3d' as an argument in the
    draw() instruction.

- widgets.py:

KNOWN PROBLEMS:
--------------
 - With the mouse zoom function, you can not zoom beyond the center of the
   displayed scene. (You can do it using the zoom buttons)
 - Mouse zooming does not work correctly in projective mode.
 - Mouse zooming will make a jump after a flyAlong().
