This is the TODO file for the pyFormex project.

This files holds the plans for new features, enhancements and changes that we
will try to implement in the future releases. 
There is no guarantee that the tasks mentioned here will indeed be completed
in time (if ever!). It is mainly intended for the developers, to see who is
working on what.


Each task can have the following keys:
 dev(eloper)
 sta(tus)
 rem(arks)


* Release 0.8.1:
   - Default focus
      dev: bverheg
      sta: IDEA
      rem: Default focus should set camera distance based on the
      largest cross dimension in the shortest viewport direction,
      and use angle zooming to increase the image if the cross
      section is not square and aligned with the viewport, .
      
      
   - Multiple views:
      dev: bverheg
      sta: PARTIAL
      rem: Need to make more versatile: link contents, position, number
      
   - Faster loading of large STL models (possibly in C):
      dev: bverheg
      sta: PARTIAL
      rem: Done via external 'gts': transform to GTS format
      Should be implemented as C function 

   - Final surface format ??
      
   - Expand the Abaqus exporter:
      
   - Export FEA models in Fluent format: 
      dev: pmortier?
      sta: INITIATED
      
   - Step by step execution of scripts
      dev: bverheg
      sta: PARTIAL
      rem: Possible if the script is 'simple'. 
      
   - Display camera settings: 
      This could be made part of a generalized 'Camera handling'
      plugin which could provide also things like move a camera
      along a path. 
      
   - Provide a formian to pyformex translator
      
   - Derive BBoxActor from GridActor

   - Create PLANE objects
      dev: bverheg
      sta: PARTIAL
