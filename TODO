This is the TODO file for the pyFormex project.

This files holds the plans for new features, enhancements and changes that we
will try to implement in the future releases. 
There is no guarantee that the tasks mentioned here will indeed be completed
in time (if ever!). It is mainly intended for the developers, to see who is
working on what.


Each task can have the following keys:
 dev(eloper)
 sta(tus)
 rem(arks)


* Release 0.6 : 

 - Multiple views:
     dev: bverheg
     sta: PARTIAL
     rem: Need to make more versatile: link contents, position, number

 - Rendering of values on the domain:
     dev: bverheg
     sta: INITIATED
     rem: Some basic classes available.
          Feasability demonstrated through some examples: *_calpy.py

 - Interactive selection/transformation:
     dev: bverheg
     sta: PARTIAL
     rem: partially implemented and in Formex menu and local scripts

 - Faster Formex->FeModel transformation (possibly implement in C):
     dev: bverheg
     sta: PARTIAL
     rem: A (moderate) speedup of the default transformation has been
          achieved. For stl surface, an important speedup is achieved
          by using the stl->gts transform.

 - Faster loading of large STL models (possibly in C):
     dev: bverheg
     sta: PARTIAL
     rem: Done via external 'gts': transform to GTS format
          Should be implemented as C function 

 - Export FEA models in Fluent format: 
     dev: pmortier?
     sta: INITIATED

 - Step by step execution of scripts
     dev: bverheg
     sta: PARTIAL
     rem: Possible if the script is 'simple'. 

 - Add default values and timeout to user interaction widgets

 - Display camera settings: 

 - Provide a formian to pyformex translator


* Release 0.9 :
 - Dedicated editor ? 


* Release 1.0:
 - Conquer the world ;)
