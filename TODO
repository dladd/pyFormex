This is the TODO file for the pyFormex project.

This files holds the plans for new features, enhancements and changes that we
will try to implement in the future releases. 
There is no guarantee that the tasks mentioned here will indeed be completed
in time (if ever!). It is mainly intended for the developers, to see who is
working on what.


Each task can have the following keys:
 dev(eloper)
 sta(tus)
 rem(arks)
