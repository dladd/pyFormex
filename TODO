This is the TODO file for the pyFormex project.

This files holds the plans for new features, enhancements and changes that we
will try to implement in the future releases. 
There is no guarantee that the tasks mentioned here will indeed be completed
in time (if ever!). It is mainly intended for the developers, to see who is
working on what.


Each task can have the following keys:
 dev(eloper)
 sta(tus)
 rem(arks)

o [bverheg] Release 0.5 :


 - Detect and register extension software (calpy,tetgen,admesh,gl2ps,
     commands: awk, )
     dev: bverheg
     sta: DONE
 - Turn the menu plugins (STL, Formex) into importable modules
     dev: bverheg
     sta: DONE
 - Multiple views:
     dev: bverheg
     sta: PARTIAL
     rem: One to Four independent viewports are available.
          In future, linking of viewports will be possible.
 - Rendering of values on the domain:
     dev: bverheg
     sta: INITIATED
     rem: Some basic classes available.
          Feasability demonstrated through some examples: *_calpy.py
 - Manual:
     dev: all
     sta: CONTINUOUSLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT
     rem: Obviously, the manual will always stay under development. We will
          remove it from this todo list when it deals with most aspects
          of the next pyFormex release.
 - Interactive selection/transformation:
     dev: bverheg
     sta: PARTIAL
     rem: partially implemented and in Formex menu and local scripts
 - Faster Formex->FeModel transformation (possibly implement in C):
     dev: bverheg
     sta: PARTIAL
     rem: A (moderate) speedup of the default transformation has been
          achieved. For stl surface, an important speedup is achieved
          by using the stl->gts transform.
 - Faster loading of large STL models (possibly in C):
     dev: bverheg
     sta: DONE
     rem: Done via external 'gts': transform to GTS format 
 - Export FEA models in Fluent format: 
     dev: pmortier?
     sta: INITIATED
 - Group script menus into a single one
